# About This Project

NY-23 Accountability Tracker is an independent civic research project documenting the statements, votes, and actions of New York's 23rd Congressional District representative.

## Our Approach

We believe constituents deserve access to clear, verifiable information about how their representative votes and whether public statements match the congressional record.

### What We Do

- **Document public statements** from press releases, social media, interviews, and constituent correspondence
- **Compare claims with official records** including Congress.gov votes, CBO analyses, and federal agency data
- **Archive all sources** using Internet Archive and Archive.today for permanent verification
- **Present findings clearly** with full context and links to original sources

### What We Don't Do

- Speculate about motives or intentions
- Rely on anonymous sources
- Present opinion as fact
- Engage in partisan messaging
- Endorse or oppose any candidate or party

## Independence

This project is:

- **Not affiliated** with any political party, campaign, or organization
- **Not funded** by political organizations or PACs
- **Maintained independently** using public records and original research
