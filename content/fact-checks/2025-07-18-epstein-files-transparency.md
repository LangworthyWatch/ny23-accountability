## Why This Matters for NY-23

When representatives claim to support transparency while blocking binding measures and then voting for symbolic ones, constituents can't tell who actually fought for accountability versus who wanted the appearance of it. The sequence here — vote NO on binding amendment, then vote YES on resolution that "forces the release of NOTHING" (Rep. Massie's words) — is a pattern voters should understand.

## Statement

**Source:** Press Statement, July 18, 2025
**Reported by:** WRFA-LP Jamestown, Quiver/Nasdaq Congressional Press

> "I stand with my Republican colleagues in demanding the full release of all credible Epstein documents—while ensuring the privacy and dignity of the victims are protected. Every individual who committed crimes—especially against minors—must face the full weight of the law."

Rep. Langworthy praised the House Rules Committee's advancement of H.Res. 589 (a GOP-backed resolution urging release of Epstein-related documents) as "a bold and necessary move to deliver long-overdue justice to the victims," while accusing Democrats of "obstruction and silence" on the issue.

**July 18, 2025 - H.Res. 589 (Non-binding Resolution)**
- **Langworthy vote:** YES

## Context

The sequence of events:

1. **July 17:** Democrats propose binding amendment to force DOJ to release Epstein files → Langworthy votes NO
2. **Files remain unreleased** due to failed amendment
3. **July 18:** Republicans introduce symbolic resolution with no enforcement power → Langworthy votes YES and issues press statement claiming to "demand full release"

Local media noted the contradiction: "After voting no earlier this week on an amendment to have DOJ release the Epstein files, Congressman Nick Langworthy has voted yes on moving a Republican resolution forward...."
