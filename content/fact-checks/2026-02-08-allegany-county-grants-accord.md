## Why This Matters for NY-23

Allegany County residents deserve to know which federal grants their representative actually secured versus which would have arrived regardless. Head Start continuation funding flows automatically to programs meeting performance standards — Congress members play no role. ARC grants are state-administered competitive programs. Meanwhile, federally-funded social services in the county faced disruption from executive orders Langworthy supports. Understanding what's genuine credit versus announcement allows constituents to evaluate representation accurately.

## Statement

**Source:** Multiple Langworthy press releases and local news, 2024-2025

Langworthy has announced multiple federal grants for Allegany County, including Head Start funding, ARC sewer infrastructure grants, and Cornell Cooperative Extension funding. Meanwhile, a federally-funded social services provider in the county suspended operations due to a presidential executive order.

## The Grants Langworthy Announced

### $2.6 Million Head Start Grant

**Langworthy's announcement:** Over $2.6 million in federal grants for Head Start projects in Allegany County.

**The context:**
- Head Start grants operate on a **5-year Designation Renewal System** with annual continuation funding processed administratively through HHS
- Programs meeting performance standards receive **automatic renewals without competition**
- Congress members have **no role** in the Head Start grant award process
- This is routine continuation funding that would flow regardless of any congressional action

---

### $560,000 ARC Sewer Infrastructure Grant

**Langworthy's announcement:** $560,000 federal grant to improve sewer infrastructure in Allegany County.

**The context:**
- Appalachian Regional Commission grants are **competitive but state-administered**
- Applications begin at the state government level and undergo state-level review before ARC commission consideration
- Congress members play **no formal role** in selecting, nominating, or awarding individual ARC Area Development grants
- These are established federal-state partnership programs, not member-directed earmarks

---

### $254,169 Cornell Cooperative Extension Grant

**Langworthy's announcement:** $254,169 in federal funding for Cornell Cooperative Extension of Allegany County.

**The context:**
- This is a **Community Project Funding (earmark)** request — one of the few items where Langworthy's office specifically directed appropriations funding
- Unlike the Head Start and ARC grants above, this is a case where congressional direction played a direct role
- This distinction is **not made clear** in Langworthy's communications, where earmarks and formula grants are presented with identical framing

---

### $2.5 Million in Combined Grants

**Local coverage:** The Olean Times Herald reported Langworthy announcing $2.5 million in combined grants for Allegany County, and WLEA covered additional grant announcements.

---

## What Langworthy Can Claim vs. What He Announced

| Grant | Amount | Langworthy's Role |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Cornell Cooperative Extension | $254,169 | **Earmark — legitimate credit** |
| Head Start | ~$2.6M | **HHS automatic continuation — announcement only** |
| ARC Sewer Grant | $560,000 | **State-administered competitive — announcement only** |

Only the $254,169 CCE earmark represents funding Langworthy specifically directed. The other grants — totaling over $3 million — flow through established federal programs over which he exercised no documented influence.

---

## ACCORD Service Suspension

While Langworthy was announcing federal grants, a significant federal policy action was impacting services in the same county.

**ACCORD Corporation** — a community action agency providing social services in Allegany County including anti-poverty programs, housing assistance, and workforce development — **suspended services following a presidential executive order**.

Per Allegany Hope reporting, the suspension disrupted direct services to vulnerable residents in one of NY-23's poorest counties.

### The Contrast

| Action | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Langworthy announces federal grants | Positive press coverage |
| Federal executive order suspends ACCORD services | Service disruption for vulnerable residents |
| Langworthy's public response to ACCORD suspension | Not documented |

Allegany County has one of the **highest poverty rates in New York State**. The suspension of a community action agency's services while celebrating grant announcements highlights the disconnect between press-release governance and policy consequences on the ground.

## Langworthy at the Allegany County Legislature

Local coverage from the Wellsville Sun documented Langworthy **taking questions from the floor of the Allegany County Legislature**. This represents one of the few documented instances of Langworthy engaging directly with local elected officials in a public setting — a contrast with his [documented absence from public town halls](/fact-checks/2025-04-constituent-access-town-halls/).

---

## Questions This Raises

1. Of the ~$3.4 million in grants Langworthy announced for Allegany County, what specific actions — beyond issuing press releases — did his office take?

2. When ACCORD suspended services due to a federal executive order, did Langworthy's office intervene on behalf of affected Allegany County residents?

3. Why is the $254,169 earmark (which he legitimately directed) presented with the same framing as the $2.6M Head Start continuation grant (which is automatic)?

4. In one of New York's poorest counties, how do grant announcements weigh against the suspension of direct anti-poverty services?

5. Will Langworthy's appearance at the Allegany County Legislature become a regular practice, or was it an isolated event?

---

## Assessment

Allegany County illustrates the broader credit-claiming pattern identified across NY-23. Of the grants announced, only the $254,169 Cornell Cooperative Extension earmark represents funding Langworthy specifically directed. The larger amounts — Head Start, ARC — flow through established federal programs with no congressional role in the award process.

The simultaneous ACCORD service suspension adds a dimension absent from Langworthy's public messaging: federal policy actions he supports (or does not oppose) are directly impacting service delivery in the same communities where he claims credit for federal dollars.

**Verdict: MISSING CONTEXT** — Grant announcements are accurate but lack attribution clarity. ACCORD service disruption adds unreported policy impact.
