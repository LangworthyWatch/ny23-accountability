## Why This Matters for NY-23

When a constituent asks about government transparency, they deserve a complete answer. Langworthy says he "never opposed" releasing Epstein files and "proudly supported" the bill. But his letter doesn't mention that he refused to sign the discharge petition that actually forced the vote — a petition the White House called "a hostile act." Only 4 Republicans had the courage to sign: Massie, Greene, Boebert, and Mace. Langworthy wasn't among them. The bill passed 427-1 only after Trump reversed position.

## What the Letter Omits

**Langworthy's stated reason for not signing the petition** (Erie News Now, October 2025):
> "I wholeheartedly support justice and complete transparency for the Epstein victims, which is why, in addition to co-sponsoring and voting for the full release of grand jury testimony, I am working with my House Oversight Committee colleagues to conduct the most comprehensive investigation to date."

**The problem:** The Oversight Committee approach allowed leadership to delay indefinitely. The discharge petition actually forced a vote - over administration opposition that Langworthy did not defy.

## Fact-Check: His Claims vs. The Record

| Langworthy's Claim | The Record | Verdict |
|--------------------|------------|---------|
| "I have never opposed the release" | Voted NO on July 14 amendment; did NOT sign discharge petition | **MISLEADING** |
| "I proudly supported H.R. 4405" | Did NOT sign petition that forced the vote; voted YES only after Trump reversed | **MISSING CONTEXT** |
| "The Epstein case should never be politicized" | White House called the discharge petition "a hostile act to the administration" | **IRONIC** |

## Questions This Raises

1. If Langworthy "never opposed" release, why didn't he sign the discharge petition alongside Massie, Greene, Boebert, and Mace?

2. Did the White House pressure campaign influence his decision not to sign?

3. Does voting YES after Trump reversed course - when the bill was guaranteed to pass 427-1 - constitute "proudly supporting" transparency?

4. Why does the letter not mention the discharge petition at all?

## In Plain Language

The Epstein Files bill passed 427-1. Langworthy voted YES. Sounds like strong support, right?

Here's what his letter doesn't tell constituents:
- The bill only came to a vote because of a **discharge petition** that bypassed leadership
- A White House official called signing the petition "a very hostile act to the administration"
- Only **4 Republicans** signed: Massie, Greene, Boebert, Mace
- Langworthy **did not sign**
- Rep. Pat Ryan publicly called him out by name for refusing to sign
- The bill passed only **after Trump reversed** his position

"Proudly supporting" a bill that passes 427-1 after your party's president says it's okay is different from signing a petition to force a vote when the administration opposes it. The letter omits the petition entirely.
