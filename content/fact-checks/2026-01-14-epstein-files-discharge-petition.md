## Why This Matters for NY-23

When a constituent asks about government transparency, they deserve a complete answer. Langworthy says he "never opposed" releasing Epstein files and "proudly supported" the bill. But his letter doesn't mention that he refused to sign the discharge petition that actually forced the vote — a petition the White House called "a hostile act." Only 4 Republicans signed: Massie, Greene, Boebert, and Mace. Langworthy was not among them. The bill passed 427-1 only after Trump reversed position.

Then, on February 18, 2026, the House Oversight Committee — on which Langworthy sits — deposed Les Wexner about his ties to Epstein. Zero Republican members attended. Langworthy was in Dunkirk, NY that day for a Conservation Club event.

## What the Letter Omits

**Langworthy's stated reason for not signing the petition** (Erie News Now, October 2025):
> "I wholeheartedly support justice and complete transparency for the Epstein victims, which is why, in addition to co-sponsoring and voting for the full release of grand jury testimony, I am working with my House Oversight Committee colleagues to conduct the most comprehensive investigation to date."

**The problem:** The Oversight Committee approach allowed leadership to delay indefinitely. The discharge petition actually forced a vote - over administration opposition that Langworthy did not defy.

## The Wexner Deposition (February 18, 2026)

On February 18, 2026, the House Oversight Committee conducted a transcribed deposition of **Les Wexner** — the billionaire founder of L Brands (Victoria's Secret) and Epstein's most prominent financial patron — at Wexner's mansion in New Albany, Ohio. The deposition lasted approximately five hours.

**Key facts about the deposition:**

| Detail | Record |
|--------|--------|
| Subject | Les Wexner — Epstein's primary financial benefactor for decades |
| Location | Wexner's Ohio mansion (New Albany) |
| Duration | ~5 hours |
| Republican members present | **Zero** |
| Democratic members present | Multiple, including Ranking Member Connolly |
| Langworthy's committee status | **Sitting member** of the House Oversight Committee |
| Langworthy's location on Feb 18 | Dunkirk, NY — Conservation Club event (per Facebook post) |

**What Wexner testified:** According to news reports, Wexner denied knowledge of Epstein's crimes, said he was "horrified" when he learned of them, and described Epstein as having "deceived" him. He acknowledged giving Epstein broad power of attorney over his finances.

**Republican absence:** The absence of all Republican Oversight members was noted in multiple news reports. Committee Republicans did not provide a public explanation for their collective absence. Chairman James Comer had previously expressed support for the Epstein investigation.

**Why this matters:** In October 2025, Langworthy specifically cited his Oversight Committee work as the reason he did not need to sign the discharge petition:

> "I am working with my House Oversight Committee colleagues to conduct the most comprehensive investigation to date."

When the committee conducted one of its highest-profile depositions — questioning the man who bankrolled Epstein's operation — Langworthy did not attend.

## Fact-Check: His Claims vs. The Record

| Langworthy's Claim | The Record | Verdict |
|--------------------|------------|---------|
| "I have never opposed the release" | Voted NO on July 14 amendment; did NOT sign discharge petition | **MISLEADING** |
| "I proudly supported H.R. 4405" | Did NOT sign petition that forced the vote; voted YES only after Trump reversed | **MISSING CONTEXT** |
| "The Epstein case should never be politicized" | White House called the discharge petition "a hostile act to the administration" | **IRONIC** |
| "Working with my House Oversight Committee colleagues to conduct the most comprehensive investigation" | Did not attend the Wexner deposition — a five-hour questioning of Epstein's primary financial patron | **MISSING CONTEXT** |

## Questions This Raises

1. If Langworthy "never opposed" release, why didn't he sign the discharge petition alongside Massie, Greene, Boebert, and Mace?

2. Did the White House pressure campaign influence his decision not to sign?

3. Does voting YES after Trump reversed course — when the bill was guaranteed to pass 427-1 — constitute "proudly supporting" transparency?

4. Why does the letter not mention the discharge petition at all?

5. Langworthy cited his Oversight Committee work as justification for not signing the discharge petition. Why did he not attend the Wexner deposition — one of the committee's highest-profile Epstein-related proceedings?

6. Zero Republican Oversight members attended the Wexner deposition. Was the absence coordinated, or did each member independently choose not to attend?

7. Langworthy was in Dunkirk, NY on the day of the deposition. Was the Conservation Club event scheduled before or after the deposition was announced?

## In Plain Language

There are three parts to this story:

**Part 1: The Vote.** The Epstein Files bill passed 427-1. Langworthy voted YES — but only after Trump reversed his opposition. The bill reached the floor because of a discharge petition that bypassed leadership. The White House called signing it "a hostile act." Only 4 Republicans signed. Langworthy did not.

**Part 2: The Justification.** When asked why he didn't sign the petition, Langworthy said he was "working with my House Oversight Committee colleagues to conduct the most comprehensive investigation to date." In other words: he didn't need to sign the petition because the committee was handling it.

**Part 3: The Deposition.** On February 18, 2026, that same committee deposed **Les Wexner** — the billionaire who bankrolled Epstein's operation for decades. Zero Republican members attended. Langworthy, a sitting Oversight Committee member, was in Dunkirk at a Conservation Club event.

The pattern: Langworthy voted YES when it was safe, cited his committee work to avoid the petition, and then did not show up when the committee questioned Epstein's most prominent financial patron.
