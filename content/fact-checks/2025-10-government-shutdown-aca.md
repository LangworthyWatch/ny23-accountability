## Statement

**Source:** Public statements, September-November 2025
**Reported by:** WLEA New York, WSKG Public Radio

On avoiding shutdowns:
> "Shutting down the government is not the solution. We must ensure critical services continue and our military families don't miss a paycheck."

On responsible governance:
> "Governing means putting your country first...you keep the lights on in the government...that's what responsible leadership looks like."

Rep. Langworthy emphasized his commitment to "securing funding for the federal government" and voted for short-term continuing resolutions in 2023 to avoid shutdowns.

- Program nearly ran out of funding during shutdown
- New York declared emergency, spent $65 million on food banks

**Healthcare**
- Eight of twelve hospitals in NY-23 were financially stressed
- Letting ACA subsidies lapse would increase uncompensated care burden
