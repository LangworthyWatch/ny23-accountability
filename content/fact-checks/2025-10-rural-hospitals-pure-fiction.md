## Westfield Memorial Hospital: The Facts

**What actually happened:**
* January 2025: Hospital announced conversion to Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) status
* **Closed:** 4-bed inpatient unit entirely
* **Result:** Patients requiring hospital stays exceeding 24 hours must now transfer to St. Vincent's in Erie, PA (approximately 30 miles away)
* **Added:** Mobile MRI services

**Administrator Rodney Buchanan stated:** "Maintaining a 24/7 inpatient unit is costly, and the expenses aren't warranted by the volume we see."

Closing inpatient services while adding diagnostic imaging represents an **altered mission**, not an expansion.

## Rural Health Transformation Program: Context Langworthy Omits

**What the $50B RHTP actually does:**
* Created specifically to partially offset cuts from OBBB that Langworthy voted for
* **Temporary:** 5 years of funding
* **Permanent:** Medicaid cuts continue indefinitely

**KFF Analysis:**
* RHTP offsets only **37% of the $137 billion** in rural Medicaid spending cuts over a decade
* Federal Medicaid spending in rural areas estimated to decline by **$155 billion** over 10 years under OBBB
* RHTP represents about **$50 billion** temporary offset

**Observer Today columnist Andrea Hatfield:** "Langworthy called the $50 Billion Rural Health Transformation Program 'one of the largest federal investments in our history to support rural healthcare.' Why was this bill necessary? Because the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a bill Langworthy voted for, made drastic cuts to Medicaid."
