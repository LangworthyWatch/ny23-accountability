## The Data: NY Leads Nation in At-Risk Hospitals

**Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform (CHQPR) Analysis:**

| Metric | New York Data | National Rank |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Rural hospitals at immediate risk | **45%** (23 hospitals) | **#1 in nation** |
| At risk within 6-7 years | **57%** (29 hospitals) | Among highest |
| NY-23 safety net hospitals | 7 hospitals | — |

**Becker's Hospital Review (August 2025):**
* 25 rural hospitals in NY (51%) are financially vulnerable
* 16 (33%) expected to close within 2-3 years

## NY-23 Hospital Financial Status

**Fiscal Policy Institute identified 8 of 12 NY-23 hospitals** as dependent on Medicaid for more than 25% of net patient revenue:

| Hospital | County | Operating Margin | Medicaid Dependency |
|----------|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Westfield Memorial** | Chautauqua | **-59.1%** | High |
| **Upper Allegheny/Olean General** | Cattaraugus | **-31.1%** | High |
| **Schuyler Hospital** | Schuyler | **-23.1%** | High |
| **UPMC Chautauqua (Jamestown)** | Chautauqua | **-17.4%** | **37%** |
| **Cuba Memorial** | Allegany | Negative | **42%** (~100 employees) |
| **Arnot-Ogden** | Chemung | Negative | **42%** (2,200 employees) |

These hospitals are already operating at **deeply negative margins** before additional Medicaid cuts take effect.

## Westfield Memorial Hospital: The Facts

**What actually happened:**
* January 2025: Hospital announced conversion to Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) status
* **Closed:** 4-bed inpatient unit entirely
* **Result:** Patients requiring hospital stays exceeding 24 hours must now transfer to St. Vincent's in Erie, PA (approximately 30 miles away)
* **Added:** Mobile MRI services

**Administrator Rodney Buchanan stated:** "Maintaining a 24/7 inpatient unit is costly, and the expenses aren't warranted by the volume we see."

Closing inpatient services while adding diagnostic imaging represents an **altered mission**, not an expansion.

**Operating margin: -59.1%** — the worst in the district.

## OBBBA Impact: What CBO Projects

**CBO Scoring of H.R. 1 (One Big Beautiful Bill Act):**

| Category | 10-Year Impact |
|----------|---------------|
| Medicaid/CHIP cuts | **$1.02 trillion** |
| Dually eligible losing Medicaid | **1.3 million** people |
| Rural Medicaid spending decline | **$155 billion** |

**Healthcare Association of New York State projects:**
- **$8 billion** in cuts to New York hospitals
- **34,000** lost hospital jobs statewide

## Rural Health Transformation Program: Context Langworthy Omits

**What the $50B RHTP actually does:**
* Created specifically to partially offset cuts from OBBBA that Langworthy voted for
* **Temporary:** 5 years of funding
* **Permanent:** Medicaid cuts continue indefinitely

**The math:**
* Spread across ~2,086 rural hospitals nationally
* Averages roughly **$4.5M per hospital per year** for five years
* Compare to Westfield's -59.1% operating margin

**KFF Analysis:**
* RHTP offsets only **37%** of the $137 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over a decade
* Federal Medicaid spending in rural areas estimated to decline by **$155 billion** over 10 years under OBBBA
* RHTP represents about **$50 billion** temporary offset

**Observer Today columnist Andrea Hatfield:** "Langworthy called the $50 Billion Rural Health Transformation Program 'one of the largest federal investments in our history to support rural healthcare.' Why was this bill necessary? Because the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a bill Langworthy voted for, made drastic cuts to Medicaid."

## District Impact by County

| County | Key Hospital | Risk Factors |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Chemung** | Arnot-Ogden (2,200 jobs) | 36% Medicaid enrollment; 12% proposed tax increase |
| **Chautauqua** | UPMC, Westfield | Two hospitals at deeply negative margins |
| **Cattaraugus** | Olean General | -31.1% margin; limited alternative employers |
| **Allegany** | Cuba Memorial | ~100 employees with few alternatives |
| **Steuben/Schuyler** | Schuyler Hospital | -23.1% margin |

## Questions This Raises

1. How is calling closure concerns "pure fiction" supported by data showing NY #1 in at-risk rural hospitals?

2. With Westfield at -59.1% margin, how does $4.5M/year temporary funding prevent closure?

3. Why is closing inpatient services described as "expanding its mission"?

4. If RHTP offsets only 37% of cuts, what happens to the other 63%?

5. What is Langworthy's plan for the 2,200 Arnot-Ogden employees if that hospital fails?

## Assessment

The characterization of hospital closure concerns as **"pure fiction"** is not supported by:
- CBO projections
- Fiscal Policy Institute analysis
- Healthcare Association of New York State estimates
- Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform data

These independent analyses project **$8 billion in cuts** to New York hospitals and **34,000 lost jobs** statewide.

The $50B Rural Health fund partially offsets but **does not reverse** the structural Medicaid reduction. RHTP is temporary (5 years); Medicaid cuts are permanent.

Whether individual hospitals close depends on multiple variables, but the fiscal pressure on already-negative-margin facilities is **documented, not fictional**.

**Verdict: MOSTLY FALSE** — Data from CBO, state agencies, and independent analysts directly contradicts the "pure fiction" characterization.
