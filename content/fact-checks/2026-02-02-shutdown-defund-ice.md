## Statement

**Source:** Facebook Post, February 2, 2026

> "I am opposed to government shutdowns--and always have been-- but once again we find ourselves in one over Democrats' refusal to fund the Department of Homeland Security. This is wrong, dangerous, and puts America's ability to protect our homeland at grave risk. We cannot play political games with our national security. Democrats have been on a quest to defund ICE and implement their sanctuary policies nationwide long before tensions rose in Minnesota."

## Claim-by-Claim Analysis

### Claim 1: "Always have been" opposed to shutdowns

**Verdict: FALSE**

**December 19, 2024:** Langworthy voted **NO** on H.R. 10545, a continuing resolution that would have prevented a Christmas shutdown.

His stated reason: calling it a "bloated spending bill" with "wasteful spending."

The bill passed **366-34** and kept the government open.

**His own statement that day:** "I always believed it's critical that we do our job to keep the government open... **But that doesn't mean signing off on a bloated spending bill.**"

This demonstrates his opposition to shutdowns is conditional, not absolute.

| Date | Bill | Langworthy's Vote | Outcome |
|------|------|-------------------|---------|
| December 19, 2024 | H.R. 10545 (CR) | **NO** | Passed 366-34 |
| September 2025 | House CR | YES | Passed House, failed Senate |
| November 2025 | Shutdown-ending bill | YES | Passed 222-209 |

### Claim 2: Democrats "refused to fund" DHS

**Verdict: MISLEADING**

Democrats **accepted** a two-week continuing resolution for DHS (through February 13) while agreeing to fund five of six other appropriations bills for the full year.

The House ultimately passed the funding package **217-214**, with 21 Democrats voting yes.

This is not a "refusal to fund" — it's conditional funding pending reform negotiations following two fatal shootings of American citizens by federal agents.

### Claim 3: "Democrats have been on a quest to defund ICE"

**Verdict: MOSTLY FALSE**

**Historical legislation:** The only "abolish ICE" bill was introduced in July 2018 by Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI). It had **only 8 co-sponsors** out of 193 House Democrats. When Republicans tried to force a vote, its own sponsors announced they would vote against it. Democratic leaders explicitly rejected abolishing ICE.

**Current Democratic position:** Democrats are seeking operational reforms, not defunding:
- Requiring judicial warrants for entering homes
- Banning masks and requiring body cameras
- Ending roving immigration patrols
- Establishing a uniform code of conduct

The Democratic appropriations proposal would cut ICE by **$115 million out of approximately $10 billion** — keeping funding essentially flat.

**More importantly:** ICE already received **$75 billion over four years** through the Republican reconciliation bill passed in July 2025. Immigration enforcement would continue regardless of this appropriations dispute.

**Public polling:** 84% support body cameras for immigration agents; 69% support judicial warrants for home entry.

### Claim 4: Tensions in Minnesota followed "defund ICE" push

**Verdict: CAUSALLY REVERSED**

The timeline shows the Minneapolis shootings **caused** the funding dispute, not the other way around:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **December 4, 2025** | DHS announces Operation Metro Surge targeting Minneapolis |
| December 22, 2025 | ICE shoots Cuban immigrant in St. Paul |
| **January 7, 2026** | Renee Nicole Good killed by ICE agent |
| January 12, 2026 | Minnesota AG sues DHS; federal prosecutors resign |
| January 22, 2026 | House passes DHS funding bill |
| January 23, 2026 | Minnesota general strike |
| **January 24, 2026** | Alex Jeffrey Pretti killed by CBP agents |
| January 28, 2026 | Federal judge finds ICE violated 96+ court orders |
| January 29, 2026 | Democrats block DHS funding bill |
| January 30, 2026 | Shutdown begins |

The "defund ICE" push was a **response to** the Minneapolis shootings, not a precursor. Before the shootings, government funding was reportedly on a "glide path" to passage.

## What Actually Caused the Shutdown

**January 7, 2026:** ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed **Renee Nicole Good**, a 37-year-old mother who had just dropped her son at school.

**Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey** stated: "Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is bullshit" — referring to DHS claims she tried to run over agents.

**January 24, 2026:** CBP agents shot and killed **Alex Jeffrey Pretti**, a 37-year-old ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital, while he was filming enforcement activities.

Internal CBP documents reviewed by NPR contradicted DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's claims that he was a "domestic terrorist."

## The "Bipartisan Deal" Context

Langworthy says "we have the framework for a bipartisan deal."

**What the deal actually covered:**
- Bipartisan passage of five appropriations bills for full year
- DHS separated for two weeks of negotiations
- Senate passed the compromise 71-29

**What it does NOT include:**
Agreement on the ICE reforms that are the actual sticking point.

Senator John Thune (R-SD): Reaching a deal by February 13 is "an impossibility."

Senator John Kennedy (R-LA): Negotiations would be "about as productive and efficient as an eighth grade car wash."

## Summary Table

| Claim | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| "I have always been opposed to shutdowns" | **FALSE** — voted against CR in December 2024 |
| Democrats "refused to fund" DHS | **MISLEADING** — accepted temporary funding pending reforms |
| Democrats want to "defund ICE" | **MOSTLY FALSE** — seeking reforms; ICE has $75B already |
| Tensions rose in Minnesota after "defund" push | **CAUSALLY REVERSED** — shootings caused the dispute |
| "Bipartisan deal framework exists" | **TRUE but INCOMPLETE** — procedural only, not on reforms |

## Questions This Raises

1. If Langworthy "always" opposes shutdowns, why did he vote NO on H.R. 10545 in December 2024?
2. Does accepting a 2-week CR while funding five other agencies constitute "refusing to fund" DHS?
3. If ICE already has $75 billion from reconciliation, is the current appropriations dispute really about "defunding"?
4. Should the video evidence contradicting DHS claims about Renee Good inform how we evaluate the dispute?
