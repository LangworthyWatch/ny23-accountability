## What Bath VA means to the region

For 33,000 veterans across seven counties, Bath VA Medical Center is the closest option for inpatient care, addiction treatment, and specialized services. For a veteran in Potter County, PA, or Yates County, NY, there is no convenient alternative — the next VA facility is hours away.

Bath is also one of Steuben County's largest employers and the anchor of a healthcare network that includes clinics in Elmira, Olean, and four other outpatient sites. When staff are cut at Bath, the impact ripples across the entire Southern Tier.

Langworthy called VA problems a "staffing problem." He then co-founded the caucus that cut VA staff, introduced legislation to accelerate federal workforce departures, and publicly endorsed the mission. Here is what that means for the veterans who depend on Bath.

## Three things happening to veteran care right now

### 1. Staff are being cut at a facility that was already short-staffed

The VA shed approximately **30,000 positions** nationally between January and June 2025, primarily through hiring freezes and attrition. Bath VA experienced probationary staff dismissals in February 2025.

The VA's own inspector general found **4,434 severe staffing shortages** across all 139 VHA facilities — a **50% increase** in one year. Medical officer shortages affect 94% of facilities. Nursing shortages affect 79%.

*What this means at Bath:* A facility that was already struggling to fill positions lost staff under an initiative its own representative actively supports. Wait times grow. Appointment availability shrinks. Veterans who need care today face longer delays.

### 2. The region's primary detox facility is at risk

**Nick Stefanovic**, Director of Monroe County Veteran Services, warned that the cuts targeted critical addiction treatment positions at Bath: *"It's the primary facility that veterans use when they need detox from alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines... I fear that we are going to see the worst-case scenario, which could be veterans lose their lives because of it."*

Bath provides inpatient addiction and substance use treatment and residential detox programs for the region. There is no equivalent nearby facility.

*What this means for veterans in crisis:* A veteran in Allegany or Chemung County experiencing opioid withdrawal or alcohol crisis currently goes to Bath. If detox capacity is reduced, the next option may be hours away — or unavailable entirely. In addiction treatment, delays can be fatal.

### 3. Demand is surging while capacity contracts

PACT Act implementation is driving **25% annual increases** in new veteran disability claims — 457,919 new veterans added in FY2024 alone, with 2.44 million claims filed nationally.

More veterans are entering the system. More veterans need appointments, evaluations, and treatment. The VA response has been to reduce the workforce.

*What this means locally:* Veterans filing PACT Act claims for toxic exposure need medical evaluations, follow-up appointments, and ongoing care. Each dismissed position at Bath means longer waits for every veteran in the seven-county service area.

## What 501 VA clinicians are saying

**"The Lincoln Declaration: A Statement of Concern about the Future of Veterans' Healthcare"** was signed by 501 current and former VA clinicians (271 named, 184 anonymous). The declaration warns of:
- Workforce reductions without impact assessments
- Administrative authority expanding into clinical decisions
- Rapid growth of community care diverting resources from VHA

The clinicians requested VA backfill **30,000 vacated positions** — including 827 doctors, 2,300 nurses, 618 social workers, and 895 medical support assistants.

Langworthy has not publicly responded to the Lincoln Declaration.

## Langworthy's role — not passive, active

| Action | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **DOGE Caucus** | Founding member (November 19, 2024) |
| **Public endorsement** | "I fully support Musk's mission and I look forward to helping him achieve his goals" |
| **Legislation** | Introduced H.R. 7256 — Federal Workforce Early Separation Incentives Act |
| **Original characterization** | Called VA problems a "staffing problem" and an "incompetence problem" (August 2024) |
| **Public opposition to VA cuts** | None documented |

## What is still unaddressed

| Need | Status |
|------|--------|
| Bath VA staffing restoration | Representative supports the initiative that caused the cuts |
| Detox capacity protection | No public statement addressing Stefanovic's warning |
| PACT Act capacity planning | No documented advocacy for staffing to match rising demand |
| Response to Lincoln Declaration | 501 clinicians warned of danger — no public reply |
| Bath as regional employer | No public acknowledgment of economic impact of VA job losses in Steuben County |

## The bottom line

Langworthy identified the right problem in August 2024: VA care suffers when there aren't enough staff. Six months later, he helped drive the initiative that made that problem worse.

The VA's own inspector general says staffing shortages increased 50% in one year. The people who send veterans to Bath for treatment say lives are at risk. 501 VA clinicians signed a public warning. PACT Act enrollment is surging. And Langworthy — as a founding DOGE Caucus member who introduced legislation to accelerate federal workforce departures — has not publicly opposed a single VA workforce reduction.

Veterans in the Southern Tier don't need Washington efficiency theories. They need a doctor available when they call Bath for an appointment.

**Verdict: CONTRADICTION** — Calling it a "staffing problem" while actively supporting the initiative that cuts staff.
