## Statement

**Source:** Multiple Press Releases, Committee Assignments
**Reported by:** Langworthy.house.gov, Local News Coverage

**Throughout 2023-2025:** "New York's farmers and growers are some of the most important drivers of our state and district's economy."

Langworthy has repeatedly emphasized his agricultural credentials:
- Member of House Agriculture Committee
- Introduced six agriculture-related bills (GRAPE Act, dairy pricing legislation, maple syrup bill, etc.)
- Regular visits to farms in NY-23
- "As a proud member of the House Agriculture Committee, I'm committed to ensuring our rural communities have the resources they need to thrive"

---

## The District

**NY-23 is heavily agricultural:**

- Major dairy operations throughout Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, and Allegany counties
- Lake Erie Grape Belt (one of nation's largest Concord grape regions)
- Maple syrup production
- Vegetable and fruit farming
- Agricultural processing facilities

**Labor Reality:**

Per USDA Labor Department data, approximately **49% of U.S. farmworkers are undocumented**. This percentage is higher for certain sectors like dairy and grape harvesting.

## The Bill

**Farm Workforce Modernization Act:**
- **118th Congress:** H.R. 4319
- **119th Congress:** H.R. 3227
- **Previous versions:** H.R. 1603 (117th Congress, passed House 247-174)

**What it does:**
- Creates certified agricultural worker (CAW) status for current farmworkers
- Establishes pathway to legal status for workers meeting certain criteria
- Reforms H-2A temporary agricultural worker program
- **Includes specific visa allocations for dairy industry**
- Addresses wage requirements and housing standards

**Support:**
- American Farm Bureau Federation
- National Milk Producers Federation
- National Council of Agricultural Employers
- Multiple state Farm Bureaus
- **Bipartisan**: Has passed House twice with significant Republican support

---

## Langworthy's Position

**What he has NOT done:**

Langworthy is **not a cosponsor** of the Farm Workforce Modernization Act in either the 118th or 119th Congress.

He has made no public statements supporting the legislation.

He has not advocated for its passage despite it being the primary bipartisan solution to farm labor shortages.

**What he HAS done:**

- Introduced **H.R. 565** (GRAPE Act) - crop insurance for freeze damage
- Introduced **H.R. 3550** (Market-Driven Inventory System) - dairy pricing
- Introduced **H.R. 3638** - maple syrup producer support
- Cosponsored other agriculture bills focused on pricing, regulation, trade

**All of these bills address symptoms of farm struggles. None address the workforce crisis that makes farming operations difficult to maintain.**

---

## The Contradiction

**Langworthy's immigration rhetoric vs. agricultural reality:**

While opposing pathways to legal status for farmworkers, Langworthy promotes himself as champion of:

**Dairy farmers** → who depend on immigrant labor for milking operations
**Grape growers** → who depend on immigrant labor for harvest
**Agricultural processors** → who depend on immigrant labor year-round

---

## The Agricultural Community's Position

**New York Farm Bureau (2021):**
"Farm Bureau supports H.R. 1603 as a vital step toward ensuring the availability of an agricultural workforce and the economic security of farm families."

**National Milk Producers Federation:**
"Dairy producers face critical labor shortages. This legislation provides the certainty dairy farms need to plan for the future."

**American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall (May 2025, upon H.R. 3227 reintroduction):**
"Agriculture's workforce crisis demands urgent action... We urge Congress to swiftly move this bipartisan bill."

---

## What NY-23 Farmers Face Without Reform

**Current H-2A Program Problems:**
- Complex application process
- Lengthy delays (often 6+ months)
- Not designed for year-round dairy operations
- High costs for small farms
- Housing requirements difficult for rural areas

**Without legal workforce:**
- Risk of ICE raids disrupting operations
- Unable to retain experienced workers
- Difficulty planning long-term farm investments
- Higher costs passed to consumers

## The Pattern

| Issue | Langworthy's Position |
|-------|---------------------|
| Dairy pricing | ✅ Introduced legislation |
| Grape crop insurance | ✅ Introduced legislation |
| Maple syrup support | ✅ Introduced legislation |
| **Farm labor shortage** | ❌ No support for primary solution |
| Border security rhetoric | ✅ Consistent messaging |
| Immigration reform | ❌ Opposes pathways to legal status |

---

## The 2024 Context

**Why this matters for 2024-2025:**

Langworthy has used immigration as a central campaign issue, emphasizing border security and opposing "amnesty."

But his agricultural constituents need legal workforce solutions—not just border enforcement.

The Farm Workforce Modernization Act addresses both:
- Stricter enforcement provisions
- Legal status for essential agricultural workers
- Reformed H-2A program

**By remaining silent, Langworthy:**
- Avoids taking a position that might conflict with immigration hardline
- Leaves NY-23 farmers without the workforce legislation they need
- Can claim to "fight for farmers" while avoiding the most controversial agricultural issue

---

## Questions This Raises

1. How can Langworthy claim to champion NY-23 farmers while not supporting the bipartisan legislation the agricultural community has identified as essential?

2. If 49% of farmworkers are undocumented, how do dairy and grape operations continue without workforce reform?

3. Why introduce bills for crop insurance and pricing while ignoring the underlying labor crisis that threatens farm viability?

4. Does opposing all immigration reform while representing an agricultural district create a fundamental policy contradiction?

5. Would NY-23 farmers prefer workforce solutions or continued uncertainty about their labor supply?
