## Statement

**Source:** Constituent Letter Response, February 4, 2026

Constituent wrote expressing concerns about the ICE officer-involved shooting.

Langworthy's response:

> "As you know, on January 7, 2026, ICE officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, were conducting targeted operations when **a violent rioter weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to run over law enforcement officers**. An ICE officer, fearing for his life, acted in self-defense. Tragically, a life was lost in this incident."

## Who Was Renee Nicole Good?

- **Age:** 37 years old
- **Occupation:** Mother
- **Circumstance:** Had just dropped her son off at school
- **Status:** American citizen
- **Criminal record:** None reported related to "rioting"

---

## The Video Evidence

**Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey** publicly stated after viewing video footage of the incident:

> "Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly that **is bullshit**."

He was referring to DHS claims that Good tried to run over agents.

**What the video reportedly shows:**
- Good was shot through her car window
- The DHS narrative about her "weaponizing her vehicle" is contradicted by the footage

## Fact-Check: "Violent Rioter"

**Langworthy's Claim:** "a violent rioter weaponized her vehicle"

**The Evidence:**

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| "Violent rioter" | No evidence Good was involved in any riot or protest; she had just dropped her son at school |
| "Weaponized her vehicle" | Contradicted by video evidence per Minneapolis Mayor |
| "Attempt to run over law enforcement" | Contradicted by video evidence per Minneapolis Mayor |
| "Self-defense" | Subject of investigation; video evidence contradicts DHS narrative |

**Verdict: FALSE**

Langworthy's characterization of Renee Good as a "violent rioter" who "weaponized her vehicle" is contradicted by:
1. Video evidence viewed by Minneapolis Mayor
2. The context (dropping her son at school)
3. No evidence she was involved in any riot

---

## What Langworthy Gets Partially Right

**He does say:**
> "I strongly believe that this tragedy should be thoroughly examined and investigated to ensure all the facts are clear and accountability is upheld."

However, his letter **pre-judges the facts** by characterizing Good as a "violent rioter" before any investigation is complete, while simultaneously calling for investigation.

## Contrast: Alex Pretti Response

In a separate letter the same day about Alex Pretti (the second Minneapolis shooting victim), Langworthy wrote:

> "I also think Secretary Noem's comments to label Alex Pretti as a domestic terrorist were **unfortunate and out of line**."

**The inconsistency:** Langworthy criticizes Noem for labeling Pretti a "domestic terrorist" without evidence, but accepts and repeats the DHS characterization of Good as a "violent rioter" — which is equally contradicted by evidence.

| Victim | DHS Characterization | Langworthy's Position |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Renee Good | "Violent rioter" | Accepts and repeats |
| Alex Pretti | "Domestic terrorist" | "Unfortunate and out of line" |

## The Broader Context

This letter connects directly to:

1. **The February 2026 Shutdown:** The Minneapolis shootings were the direct cause of the DHS funding dispute
2. **Langworthy's Shutdown Post:** He blamed Democrats for "refusing to fund DHS" while characterizing the victims as violent
3. **His claim that tensions arose before the shootings:** The timeline shows the shootings caused the dispute

## Questions This Raises

1. On what evidence does Langworthy base the characterization of Good as a "violent rioter"?
2. If the Minneapolis Mayor says video evidence contradicts DHS claims, shouldn't Langworthy wait for investigation before pre-judging?
3. Why accept DHS characterization of Good but criticize Noem's characterization of Pretti?
4. How can he call for "investigation" while simultaneously stating conclusions about what happened?
