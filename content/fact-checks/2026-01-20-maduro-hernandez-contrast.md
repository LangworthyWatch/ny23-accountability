## Why This Matters for NY-23

Drug trafficking affects rural communities — opioids and other substances flow through areas with limited law enforcement resources. When a representative celebrates arresting one accused drug trafficker (Maduro) while his party's president pardoned a **convicted** one (Hernández, 400 tons of cocaine), constituents deserve to understand the inconsistency. Is the goal to fight drug trafficking, or is it selective enforcement based on political allegiance?

## Statement

**Source:** Multiple Constituent Letter Responses, January 20-25, 2026

On the Maduro arrest:

> "As you may know, in 2020, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted Nicolas Maduro on charges of narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, and corruption. These charges detail how Maduro deliberately flooded our nation with cocaine, harming American communities and threatening our national security... I fully support the President's actions and his clear message that the United States will hold criminal regimes accountable when they threaten our national security."

And:

> "With Maduro now facing justice, the United States has achieved a major milestone in the fight against narco-terrorism and transnational crime."

## The Hernandez Pardon Contrast

**November 28, 2025:** Trump pardoned Juan Orlando Hernandez, former President of Honduras.

**Who is Hernandez?**
- Convicted in SDNY (March 2024) of conspiring to import cocaine and weapons offenses
- Sentenced to **45 years** in federal prison (June 2024)
- Prosecutors proved he received millions in bribes from drug traffickers including **the Sinaloa Cartel**
- Evidence showed he helped move approximately **400 tons of cocaine** through Honduras to the U.S.

**Federal Judge P. Kevin Castel** at sentencing: Hernandez employed "considerable acting skills" to make it seem he opposed drug trafficking while he "deployed his nation's police and military to protect the drug trade."

## The Double Standard

| Figure | Crime | Outcome | Langworthy's Position |
|--------|-------|---------|----------------------|
| **Nicolas Maduro** | DOJ indictment: narco-terrorism, drug trafficking | Arrested via military operation | "Major milestone in fight against narco-terrorism" |
| **Juan Orlando Hernandez** | SDNY conviction: 400 tons of cocaine, Sinaloa Cartel ties | Pardoned after 45-year sentence | [See Hernandez fact-check] |

**Both are accused/convicted of the same core crime:** Flooding America with cocaine.

## Langworthy's Hernandez Response (January 21, 2026)

When a constituent asked about the Hernandez pardon, Langworthy responded:

> "While I understand your concerns, the President acted within his constitutional authority."

He then pivoted to attacking Biden's use of autopen for pardons.

**The contrast:**
- Maduro arrest: "Major milestone," "hold criminal regimes accountable"
- Hernandez pardon: "Constitutional authority" + deflect to Biden

---

## The Logical Problem

Langworthy celebrates arresting one accused drug trafficker (Maduro) while his party's president pardoned a **convicted** drug trafficker (Hernandez) who moved **400 tons of cocaine** to the United States.

**If the goal is holding drug traffickers accountable:**
Why pardon Hernandez?

**Trump's stated rationale for Hernandez pardon:**
> "The people of Honduras really thought he was set up... they said it was a Biden administration set-up. And I looked at the facts and I agreed with them."

---

## Form Letter Variations

At least **four variations** of the Maduro response were sent to constituents, with slight differences based on whether the constituent:
- Expressed concerns about the arrest
- Supported a War Powers Resolution
- Expressed concerns about U.S. military involvement

All versions support the operation and invoke Article II authority.

---

## War Powers Question

One constituent asked about Congress adopting a War Powers Resolution.

**Langworthy's response:**
> "While I understand your concerns regarding this operation, the President acted within his Article II constitutional authority to defend the nation."

**Congressional oversight question:**
The War Powers Act requires congressional authorization for military action. Langworthy's response defers entirely to executive authority without addressing the congressional oversight question the constituent raised.

---

## Questions This Raises

1. How can Langworthy celebrate arresting Maduro for drug trafficking while Trump pardoned Hernandez for the same crime?
2. If "holding criminal regimes accountable" is the goal, why was a convicted cartel collaborator released?
3. Should constituents concerned about drug trafficking be reassured by this inconsistency?
4. Does "constitutional authority" justify both the arrest and the pardon?

## In Plain Language

Two foreign leaders. Same core crime: flooding America with cocaine.

**Maduro** (Venezuela): Indicted for drug trafficking. Arrested via military operation. Langworthy: "A major milestone in the fight against narco-terrorism."

**Hernández** (Honduras): **Convicted** of trafficking 400 tons of cocaine with Sinaloa Cartel ties. Sentenced to 45 years. **Pardoned by Trump.** Langworthy: "The President acted within his constitutional authority."

One gets celebrated as accountability. One gets defended as legal authority. Same crime, opposite treatment.
