## Statement

**Source:** WGRZ Interview, August 22, 2024
**Reported by:** WGRZ Buffalo

Following removal of two top officials at Buffalo VA Medical Center over patient care delays, Langworthy stated:

"I am assured that this is not a budgetary problem. This is a staffing problem. This is an incompetence problem."

When asked if politicians had made promises to veterans they couldn't keep, Langworthy responded: "Oh, we can keep these promises."

## The Buffalo VA Situation

**What happened:**
* Two top officials transferred out of Buffalo VA after 42+ patients experienced delayed care
* Delays included veterans waiting months for cancer treatment referrals
* One veteran died waiting for palliative care
* Another waited 9 weeks for radiation therapy

**VA Office of Inspector General Report (September 2024):**
* Confirmed leadership and management failures at Buffalo specifically
* Found systemic issues with community care referral processes
* Recommended nationwide review of VA community care practices

Langworthy's characterization of Buffalo's problems as "incompetence, not budget" is **partially supported** by the Inspector General's findings for that specific facility.

## The Broader Context Langworthy Omitted

**VA System-Wide Budget Crisis (July 2024):**
* VA reported projected **$15 billion shortfall** for FY2025
* Shortfall attributed to:
  * PACT Act implementation (toxic exposure benefits)
  * 27% increase in veteran enrollment since 2019
  * Rising healthcare costs
* Congress passed emergency $12 billion supplemental funding (September 2024)

**VA Staffing Shortages (VA Office of Inspector General, 2024):**
* 137 of 139 VA health centers report severe staffing shortage in at least one area
* Particular shortages in nursing and psychology
* 66,000 vacancies system-wide as of 2024

## DOGE Cuts and 9/11 Health Program

**February 2025:** Langworthy joined fellow NY Republicans in condemning Trump administration DOGE cuts affecting the 9/11 Health Program at CDC

This represents a documented instance where Langworthy publicly broke with Trump administration actions he viewed as harmful to constituents.
