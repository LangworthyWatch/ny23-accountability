## Statement

**Source:** WGRZ Interview, August 22, 2024

Following removal of two top officials at Buffalo VA Medical Center over patient care delays, Langworthy stated:

> "I am assured that this is not a budgetary problem. **This is a staffing problem. This is an incompetence problem.**"

When asked if politicians had made promises to veterans they couldn't keep, Langworthy responded: "Oh, we can keep these promises."

---

## The Contradiction

Langworthy simultaneously:
1. **Describes VA problems as a "staffing problem"**
2. **Supports the workforce reduction framework that reduces VA staff**

---

## DOGE Caucus and Workforce Cuts

### Langworthy's Actions

- **Member of the DOGE Caucus** (Delivering Opportunities for Government Efficiency)
- **Introduced H.R. 7256** - Federal Workforce Early Separation Incentives Act, making it easier for agencies to offer buyouts and early retirements
- Has characterized the federal workforce as needing to be "efficient, accountable, and appropriately sized"

### VA Workforce Reductions (2025)

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| VA total staff | 484,000 | 454,000 | **-30,000** |
| Method | — | Hiring freezes, deferred resignations, attrition | — |

**February 2025:** The VA Finger Lakes Healthcare System (which includes Bath VA) confirmed **dismissals of probationary staff** as part of DOGE-related reductions.

---

## Bath VA Medical Center: District Impact

**Bath VA** (Steuben County) is the primary VA healthcare facility for NY-23 veterans:

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Veterans served | 33,000+ across district |
| Coverage area | All seven NY-23 counties |
| Additional clinics | Elmira, Olean |
| Parent system | VA Finger Lakes Healthcare |

**Staff reductions at a facility already facing shortages reduce appointment availability, extend wait times, and may force veterans to travel farther for care.**

Steuben County, as the host community, also depends on Bath VA as a **major employer**.

## OIG Report: Staffing Shortages Worsening

**VA Office of Inspector General (August 2025):**

| Finding | Data |
|---------|------|
| Severe occupational staffing shortages | **4,434** across 139 VHA facilities |
| Change from FY2024 | **+50% increase** |
| Facilities with severe shortages | 139 of 139 (100%) |
| Medical officer shortages | **94%** of facilities |
| Nursing shortages | **79%** of facilities |
| Psychologist shortages | **57%** of facilities |

This data shows staffing shortages **worsened by 50% in one year** while workforce reduction policies were being implemented.

---

## Rising Demand: PACT Act Implementation

Simultaneously, demand for VA services is **surging** due to PACT Act implementation:

| Metric | FY2024 Data |
|--------|-------------|
| New veterans added to disability compensation | **457,919** |
| Increase from prior year | **+25%** |
| PACT Act claims filed nationally | **2.44 million** |

Rising PACT Act claims require **more** staff capacity, not less.

## The Buffalo VA Situation

**What happened:**
* Two top officials transferred out of Buffalo VA after 42+ patients experienced delayed care
* Delays included veterans waiting months for cancer treatment referrals
* One veteran died waiting for palliative care
* Another waited 9 weeks for radiation therapy

**VA Office of Inspector General Report (September 2024):**
* Confirmed leadership and management failures at Buffalo specifically
* Found systemic issues with community care referral processes
* Recommended nationwide review of VA community care practices

Langworthy's characterization of Buffalo's problems as "incompetence, not budget" is **partially supported** by the Inspector General's findings for that specific facility.

---

## The Broader Context Langworthy Omitted

**VA System-Wide Budget Crisis (July 2024):**
* VA reported projected **$15 billion shortfall** for FY2025
* Shortfall attributed to:
  * PACT Act implementation (toxic exposure benefits)
  * 27% increase in veteran enrollment since 2019
  * Rising healthcare costs
* Congress passed emergency $12 billion supplemental funding (September 2024)

## Related: Social Security Office Closure

The **Social Security office in Big Flats** (Chemung County) was also listed on the DOGE website for lease non-renewal, affecting another federal service point in the district.

---

## Questions This Raises

1. How can VA problems be a "staffing problem" while supporting policies that reduce VA staff by 30,000?

2. If Bath VA already faces severe shortages (per OIG), how do further staff reductions improve care?

3. With PACT Act claims up 25%, shouldn't VA staffing increase rather than decrease?

4. What is the wait time impact at Bath VA since DOGE-related cuts began?

5. Has Langworthy publicly opposed any specific VA workforce reductions?

---

## Assessment

Langworthy describes VA problems as a **"staffing problem"** while supporting the **workforce reduction framework that reduces VA staff**.

The OIG data shows staffing shortages **worsened by 50%** in one year. Rising PACT Act claims require **more** staff capacity, not less.

These are not opposing interpretations of ambiguous data—they are **documented trends moving in opposite directions** from the policy Langworthy supports.

The tension between the rhetoric and the policy is clear; whether it constitutes a contradiction depends on whether one believes efficiency gains can offset headcount reductions at facilities already in severe shortage.

**Verdict: CONTRADICTION** — Calling it a "staffing problem" while supporting workforce cuts that worsen staffing.
