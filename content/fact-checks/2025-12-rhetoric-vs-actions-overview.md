## Why This Matters for NY-23

This overview documents a recurring pattern: public statements and campaign promises that diverge from legislative actions. From "urgent" PBM reform that never reached a vote, to immigration claims federal law contradicts, to "responsible leadership" rhetoric during a shutdown he helped cause — the gap between what's said and what's done affects real policy outcomes for NY-23 families. Understanding these patterns helps constituents evaluate future claims.

## Overview

This analysis examines instances where Rep. Nick Langworthy's public statements and campaign promises diverge from his legislative actions and votes. The documentation draws from congressional records, committee proceedings, press releases, and verified news reporting.

---

## Committee Proceedings: PBM Reform

### The Statement

**Date:** December 17, 2025
**Context:** House Oversight Committee member discussing Pharmacy Benefit Manager reform
**Source:** Press release

> "We have to act—and we have to act now"

Rep. Langworthy publicly pressed for immediate action on drug pricing through a comprehensive PBM reform package to protect seniors.

### Congressional Record

**Result:** By year's end, the House had taken no final vote on any PBM legislation.

### Analysis

Langworthy's stated urgency in committee was not matched by any legislative outcome, highlighting a gap between his rhetoric and what was actually accomplished. As a committee member, he had influence over whether bills advanced, yet no PBM reform reached the floor.

## Rural Health Funding & Immigration Claims

### The Statements

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Location:** Western New York hospital event (Westfield)
**Source:** Public remarks at community event

On illegal immigrants and healthcare:
> "[Democrats would] divert rural hospital funding to healthcare benefits for illegal immigrants"

> "I will never let Americans go to the back of the line behind undocumented people"

> "It is crystal clear that illegals have been funded through Medicaid funds"

On the Rural Health Transformation Fund:
> "One of the largest federal investments in our history... our hospitals can continue serving patients"

### The Facts

**Medicaid and ACA Law:**
- Federal law explicitly bars undocumented immigrants from Medicaid coverage
- ACA prohibits undocumented immigrants from purchasing subsidized coverage
- No federal dollars go to undocumented recipients under these programs
- **Source:** Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regulations, 42 U.S.C. § 1396b

**Rural Health Transformation Fund Reality:**
- $50 billion fund announced with eligibility restrictions
- Analysis showed most Western New York hospitals would receive little or no funding
- State and local formula constraints meant Langworthy's district hospitals weren't guaranteed benefits
- **Source:** State health department analysis, local hospital eligibility reviews

### Context

**What Langworthy Claimed:**
- Democrats would "gut" rural hospital funding for undocumented immigrants
- The Rural Health Transformation Fund would deliver significant federal dollars to his district's hospitals

**What Actually Happened:**
- No Medicaid or ACA funds go to undocumented immigrants (statutory prohibition)
- Most NY-23 hospitals didn't qualify for the Rural Health Transformation Fund he touted

### The Contradiction

Langworthy portrayed the Rural Health Transformation Fund as a major win for his district while simultaneously making false claims about Democrats diverting those same funds to undocumented immigrants—even though federal law prohibits such diversion and most local hospitals wouldn't receive the funds anyway.

## Government Shutdown Rhetoric

### The Statement

**Date:** November 14, 2025
**Context:** After 40-day federal shutdown
**Source:** WSKG radio interview

> "Governing means putting your country first... You keep the lights on in the government for the American people, and that's what responsible leadership looks like"

### Congressional Record

**September 2025: The "Clean" Funding Bill**
- **Langworthy vote:** YES
- **Bill contents:** Excluded extension of Affordable Care Act premium subsidies
- **Result:** Senate Democrats refused to pass it; government shut down at deadline

**During the Shutdown:**
- Duration: 40+ days
- Impact: Military families missed paychecks, SNAP benefits threatened, federal services halted

**Langworthy's Position:**
- Supported the clean bill that omitted ACA subsidies
- Voted with GOP colleagues who rejected Democratic proposals that included subsidies
- These votes helped trigger and prolong the shutdown

### Analysis

Langworthy voted for a measure that contributed to triggering the shutdown, yet afterward portrayed himself as the champion of "keeping the lights on." His rhetoric about "responsible leadership" conflicts with his party-line votes that led to the government closure.

### Previous Pattern

Under President Biden, Langworthy had supported similar "clean" funding bills. The difference: in 2025, his party held leverage and chose to force a shutdown over ACA subsidies.

---

## Veterans and Appropriations

### Campaign Promises

**2022 and 2024 campaigns:**
- Emphasized strong support for veterans
- Promised "no cuts to Social Security/Medicare"
- Campaign materials featured veterans' issues prominently

### Congressional Record

**NDAA and Veterans Measures:**
- Voted for annual defense policy bills (NDAA)
- Supported veterans' measures as part of GOP coalition

**Budget Proposals:**
- Supported Republican spending caps that analysts warned could pressure cuts to veterans' benefits and Social Security
- Voted for appropriations and debt-limit bills under GOP terms that included spending reductions
- Backed budget frameworks that could indirectly reduce mandatory spending programs

### The Tension

While Langworthy voted for individual veterans' bills, he also supported broader GOP budget proposals that included spending constraints on the very programs he campaigned on protecting. This creates a divergence between his campaign promises to "protect veterans and seniors" and the funding outcomes of the comprehensive budget bills he supported.

**Note:** Critics have pointed out this contrast between rhetoric and the content of GOP budgets, though Langworthy has not publicly addressed the discrepancy.

## Constituent Access and Transparency

### The Claims

**Public messaging:**
- Emphasized accessibility to constituents
- Touted telephone town halls as engagement
- Accused Democrats of "undermining accountability"

### Documented Behavior

**In-Person Engagement:**
- Notably refused to hold in-person town halls
- Routinely dismisses local reporters' questions
- Has stated he won't cater to "small angry groups"

**Quote on accountability:**
> "I won't answer to small angry groups"
— Response to constituents requesting face-to-face forums

### Analysis

While presenting himself as responsive to constituents, Langworthy avoids direct Q&A formats. His public statements about accountability and "listening to voters" clash with his refusal to engage in traditional town hall forums.

**Context:** Many constituents from across the political spectrum have requested in-person town halls, which are standard practice for congressional representatives.

## "Fiscal Responsibility" Framing: Federal Cuts Become County Costs

### The Rhetoric

Langworthy frequently deploys language including:
- "Fiscal responsibility"
- "Government efficiency"
- "Taxpayer protection"
- Opposition to "waste" and "fraud"

He is a member of the **DOGE Caucus** (Delivering Opportunities for Government Efficiency).

### The Mechanism: Cost Transfers

Federal spending reductions **do not always result in net savings** for constituents. In many cases, they **shift costs to state and county governments**.

**OBBBA SNAP provisions:**

| Federal Change | NY Impact |
|----------------|-----------|
| Administrative cost-sharing drops from 50% to 25% | ~$200M shifted to counties |
| Benefit costs shift to states with error rates above 6% | ~$1.2B annually to NY |
| New York's county-based system | Costs land on local property taxes |

**Medicaid reductions** similarly shift costs downward through New York's county Medicaid cost-sharing structure.

### Local Evidence

**Chemung County's proposed 12% tax increase for 2026** reflects the kind of local fiscal pressure that federal cost-shifting compounds.

### The Framing Question

The rhetoric of "fiscal responsibility" is **accurate at the federal level**—these provisions do reduce federal spending.

But for NY-23 constituents who pay **both federal taxes and county property taxes**, the relevant question is **total cost burden**, not just the federal line item.

**When federal cuts become county cost increases, the "savings" are redistributed, not eliminated.**

### What's Missing from Local Coverage

No local reporting has examined this cost-transfer mechanism as it applies specifically to NY-23 counties.

## Summary: Pattern of Divergence

The documented instances reveal a consistent pattern:

1. **Committee Work vs. Urgency Claims:** Public calls for "immediate action" on PBM reform with no legislative follow-through
2. **Immigration & Healthcare:** False claims about Medicaid funding for undocumented immigrants, contradicting federal law
3. **Rural Hospital Funding:** Touting benefits that most district hospitals won't receive
4. **Government Shutdown:** "Keep lights on" rhetoric after voting for measures that led to 40-day closure
5. **Veterans/Seniors:** Campaign promises to protect benefits while supporting budgets with spending constraints
6. **Constituent Access:** Claims of accessibility while refusing traditional town hall formats
7. **Fiscal Responsibility:** Federal "savings" that shift costs to county property taxes
