## Statement

**Source:** Press Conference, November 13, 2025; WRFA Interview
**Reported by:** WSKG, WRFA-LP Jamestown

"There's some people that make $300,000 or $400,000 a year that are somehow leveraging that into free health care. I don't agree with that."

Langworthy stated he would not "blanketly agree to just pushing forward" the enhanced ACA tax credits, calling them "failed policy" and "Covid emergency spending" that "enriches the insurer."

## The Law

**Current ACA Premium Tax Credit Structure (as of 2025):**
* People above 400% of Federal Poverty Level pay a **maximum of 8.5%** of household income for benchmark Silver plan
* At $300,000 income: minimum payment = **$25,500/year** ($2,125/month)
* At $400,000 income: minimum payment = **$34,000/year** ($2,833/month)
* In most markets, benchmark premiums don't exceed $20,000-25,000 annually
* **Result:** People at these income levels receive **no subsidy whatsoever** because premiums already cost less than 8.5% of their income

## Context

Langworthy's claim that people earning $300,000-$400,000 receive "free health care" is **demonstrably false** under the mathematical structure of the ACA.

**Impact on NY-23 if enhanced credits expire (per Sen. Gillibrand's office):**
* Single person in Chautauqua County earning $65,000: premiums increase **$104.30/month** ($1,252/year)
* Family of four earning $130,000: premiums increase **$212.26/month** ($2,547/year)
* Over 6,300 NY-23 residents enrolled in ACA marketplace (per KFF)

**Timeline of enhanced credits:**
* Created: American Rescue Plan Act (March 2021)
* Extended: Inflation Reduction Act (August 2022)
* Set to expire: December 31, 2025
* OBBB provision: Does **not** extend enhanced credits

As of November 2025, Langworthy had not committed to voting for any extension of the credits, stating: "I think we have to find an off-ramp on how to get off of these subsidies."
