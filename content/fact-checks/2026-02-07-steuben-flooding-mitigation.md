## Statement

**Source:** Multiple Langworthy press releases, 2024-2025

Langworthy has toured flood damage and announced FEMA disaster recovery funding after recurring floods in Steuben County and surrounding areas.

> Announced **$9.5 million** in FEMA disaster recovery funding for Steuben County, including Jasper-Troupsburg School District and county road repairs.

## The Record

### Recurring Flood Events in NY-23

| Year | Event | Counties Affected |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| 2021 | Major flooding | Steuben, Chemung |
| August 2024 | Tropical Storm Debby | Steuben, Allegany, Chemung, Schuyler |
| Late 2024 | Second major flood | Steuben |
| June 2025 | Flash flooding | Steuben, Chemung |

Emergency declarations have covered Allegany, Chemung, Schuyler, and Steuben counties repeatedly.

### County Leadership Response

**Steuben County Legislature Chair Kelly Fitzpatrick (May 2025):**
> "The flooding crisis reaches breaking point... constituents had endured what should have been once-in-a-century disasters—over and over again."

### Infrastructure Context

- **FEMA flood maps** for this region were last updated in the **1980s**
- **Chemung County** has been identified as the **single most flood-prone county in New York State**
- The Southern Tier holds the **highest flood risk** in New York State

## What's Missing: Structural Mitigation

Research found **limited evidence** of Langworthy advocating for long-term flood mitigation infrastructure:

| Mitigation Type | Evidence of Advocacy |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Levee systems | Not found |
| Watershed management programs | Not found |
| Updated FEMA floodplain mapping | Not found |
| Pre-disaster mitigation grants | Not found |
| Upstream flood control | Not found |

No press release, bill introduction, or public advocacy for **proactive** flood infrastructure has been identified in the public record.

---

## The Pattern

**What IS documented:**
- Post-disaster damage tours
- FEMA disaster declarations
- Announcements of recovery funding after floods occur

**What is NOT documented:**
- Legislative efforts to prevent recurring floods
- Advocacy for updated flood maps
- Push for structural mitigation funding

---

## District Impact

| County | Flood Risk | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Steuben | Primary flood zone | Repeated emergency declarations |
| Chemung | #1 most flood-prone in NY | Recurring infrastructure damage |
| Schuyler | High vulnerability | Agricultural and residential damage |
| Allegany | Flood-prone valleys | Road and bridge damage |

Repeated post-disaster FEMA cycles without upstream mitigation investment mean the **same communities bear recurring costs**.

---

## Questions This Raises

1. Has Langworthy introduced or co-sponsored any legislation for structural flood mitigation in the Southern Tier?

2. Has he advocated for updated FEMA flood maps, given current maps are 40+ years old?

3. When the same communities flood repeatedly, is reactive disaster relief a sustainable strategy?

4. What would proactive flood infrastructure cost compared to repeated disaster recovery?

5. Has he sought pre-disaster mitigation grants for at-risk communities?

---

## Assessment

Langworthy's post-disaster response—touring damage, securing FEMA declarations and funding—is documented and appropriate.

What is also documented is the **absence of a visible long-term mitigation strategy** at the federal level.

Securing $9.5 million after each event while the underlying flood vulnerability compounds is **reactive, not preventive**.

Whether a structural mitigation push exists behind the scenes cannot be confirmed from public records. What can be confirmed is that **no press release, bill, or public advocacy for proactive flood infrastructure has been identified**.

**Verdict: MISSING CONTEXT** — Disaster response is documented; structural prevention is not.
