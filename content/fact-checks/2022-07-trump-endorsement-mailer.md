## Statement

**Source:** Conservative Party Mailer, Langworthy Campaign Text Messages, July 2022
**Reported by:** Politico, Breitbart

The New York State Conservative Party sent voters a mailer featuring a photo of Langworthy with Trump in the Oval Office captioned **"CHOSEN BY PRESIDENT TRUMP"** with text stating: "Chosen by President Trump to lead Republicans in the fight against New York's radical liberals, Nick Langworthy has a proven record of defeating Democrats and advancing our America First agenda."

A Langworthy campaign fundraising text stated: "President Trump called on Nick Langworthy to lead Republicans in the fight against New York's radical liberals."

## Documented Complaints

**Michael Caputo** (former Trump HHS spokesperson, longtime Trump confidant, Paladino ally):
* Called the wording "deceptive"
* "I find Nick's flirtations with all the synonyms for 'endorsed' to be offensive. Because it's clearly meant to confuse voters and that frankly is just not how we do things in Trump world."
* "The president doesn't like people doing this."

**Politico reported:** "Multiple people close to Trump said the former president has been made aware of the Langworthy mailer and messages, as have Trump aides."

**Republican operative close to Trump** (to Politico): "It has not gone unnoticed in Trump world where nothing gets him angrier than falsely using Trump's name to claim an endorsement."

**Paladino campaign ad:** Accused Langworthy of having "lied to voters about having Trump's endorsement"

## Langworthy Campaign Response

**Campaign consultant Chris Grant:** Called the language "very accurate and specific" because "Nick never implied that the president has endorsed him for Congress."

Grant argued the materials referenced Trump's 2019 support for Langworthy as state party chairman, not an endorsement for Congress.

---

## Context

The mailer's prominent "CHOSEN BY PRESIDENT TRUMP" headline, Oval Office photo, and text about "leading Republicans" created an impression of current presidential endorsement for the congressional race. The distinction that "chosen" referred to a 2019 party chairman selection—not the 2022 congressional race—was not made clear to voters.

This pattern of technically-accurate-but-misleading communication has continued throughout Langworthy's congressional tenure across multiple policy areas.
