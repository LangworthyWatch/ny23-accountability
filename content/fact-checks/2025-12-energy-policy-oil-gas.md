## Statement

**Source:** Press Releases, Press Conferences (2025)
**Reported by:** WRFA-LP, WNY News Now, Wellsville Sun

Langworthy has promoted his Energy Choice Act (H.R. 3699) as protecting consumers: "This is an un-American assault on our freedom, on our pocketbooks, but most importantly on our safety."

When asked about PFAS "forever chemicals" contaminating water supplies, Langworthy responded: "Down the road we might get into more specific questions with the PFAS question [...] but I would await conversations with the incoming EPA administrator."

## The Energy Choice Act: What It Does

**H.R. 3699 would:**

* Preempt local building codes requiring all-electric construction

* American Public Gas Association
* Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York

## Context

Langworthy frames the Energy Choice Act as protecting consumer freedom while:
1. Taking $66,466 from the fossil fuel industry whose interests the bill serves
2. Maintaining a 3% lifetime environmental score
3. Consistently voting against renewable energy, clean air, and climate provisions
4. Declining to offer specific solutions on PFAS contamination affecting NY communities

The bill would effectively prevent New York and other states from implementing climate policies voters and legislators have enacted, transferring regulatory authority to the federal level where fossil fuel interests have greater influence.
