## Statement

**Source:** Press Release, December 17, 2025
**Reported by:** Wellsville Sun, Olean Times Herald

"Since Congress' near-win on PBM reform in December 2024, pharmacies have closed at a net rate of more than six per day nationwide—over 2,200 in the past year alone. Since 2018, the United States has lost more than 13 percent of its pharmacies, hitting rural and underserved communities hardest."

"For rural communities like those across New York's 23rd District, the loss of a pharmacy isn't an inconvenience—it's a healthcare emergency."

## Verification

**Pharmacy closure claims: SUBSTANTIALLY ACCURATE**

Multiple independent sources corroborate Langworthy's figures:
* Ohio State University: 2,800 pharmacies closed in 2024 alone
* American Economic Liberties Project: 3,179 pharmacies closed since January 2024
* Multiple sources confirm 5-8 pharmacies closing daily
* Rural and underserved areas disproportionately affected

**PBM reform history: ACCURATE**

Bipartisan Pharmacy Benefit Manager reform legislation was removed from the December 2024 spending package at the last minute, as Langworthy described.

## Context and Open Questions

**What Langworthy advocates:**
* Comprehensive PBM reform beyond transparency-only measures
* Price transparency requirements
* Restrictions on PBM practices like spread pricing and DIR fees

**Outstanding questions:**
* Langworthy has issued press releases calling for floor votes on PBM reform
* As of December 2025, legislation has not advanced to full House vote
* His membership on Energy and Commerce Committee gives him direct influence over healthcare legislation
* Unclear what specific actions beyond press releases he has taken to advance reform

**Industry context:**
* Health Professionals rank as Langworthy's 6th largest contributor ($72,698)
* Insurance industry contributed $46,883
* These contributions come from industries with complex interests in PBM reform outcomes

This represents an issue where Langworthy's stated concerns appear genuine and his facts are accurate, though constituents may wish to monitor whether rhetoric translates to legislative action.
