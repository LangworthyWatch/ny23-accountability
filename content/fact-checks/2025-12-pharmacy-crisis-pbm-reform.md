## Why This Matters for NY-23

Rural NY-23 has lost multiple independent pharmacies, forcing residents to drive 30+ miles for prescriptions. PBM reform would directly address the pricing practices that make rural pharmacies unprofitable. When Langworthy publicly champions this reform but stays silent each time Trump kills it, the pharmacies keep closing — and constituents don't know why the "urgent" reform never passes.

## Statement

**Source:** Press Releases, Floor Speech, Wellsville Sun Interview
**Reported by:** Wellsville Sun, Langworthy.house.gov

**December 17, 2025:** "This package was ready to go last Christmas, but it was stripped out at the last minute. A full year has gone by, and the consequences of inaction are now impossible to ignore. We have to act—and we have to act now."

Langworthy has positioned himself as a leading advocate for Pharmacy Benefit Manager reform, calling pharmacy closures "a healthcare emergency" for rural communities.

---

## The Pattern: Public Advocacy, Private Silence

**What Langworthy says:** PBM reform is urgent and he's fighting for it.

**What the record shows:** Reform has been stripped from legislation three times at Trump's direction. Langworthy remained silent each time, only becoming vocal again after Trump launched his own branded initiative.

**July 1, 2025 — Senate strips PBM reform from OBBB**

* **Brownstein Hyatt law firm confirmed:** "Although included in the House version, notably absent from the final reconciliation bill were provisions to modernize and ensure pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) accountability, as well as prevent the use of spread pricing in Medicaid."
* **Applied Policy confirmed:** "The PBM reform language from the House-passed bill was not included in the final version."

**July 2, 2025 — Langworthy's floor speech (actual text):**

> "In just a short time, key provisions of the current tax code—provisions that helped power economic growth, create jobs, and lift take-home pay for millions of Americans— are set to expire.
>
> If we do nothing, we're looking at the largest tax increase in a generation. Families will see their child tax credit slashed. Small businesses will lose vital expensing tools... Workers will see their paychecks shrink...
>
> That's why the legislation before us today makes the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, and brings historic tax relief to seniors, tipped workers, and those who work overtime."

**What the floor speech reveals:**
* Entire speech focused on tax provisions
* **Zero mention of PBM reform being stripped from the bill**
* **Zero mention of healthcare at all**
* Does not inform constituents that a provision he called essential was removed

## Additional Context: What OBBB Actually Does to Drug Pricing

**What the final law DOES include (Section 71203):**
The One Big Beautiful Bill that Langworthy championed includes Section 71203, which **expands exclusions from Medicare drug price negotiation** — making it *harder* for Medicare to negotiate drug prices, not easier.

Specifically, it:
* Expands the orphan drug exclusion from the Drug Price Negotiation Program
* Allows drugs approved for "one or more rare diseases" (rather than "only one") to be excluded from negotiation
* Creates new exclusions for "former orphan drugs"
* Takes effect for drugs selected for negotiation starting January 1, 2028

**What was REMOVED from the final law:**
* PBM accountability and transparency provisions
* Prohibition on spread pricing in Medicaid
* Provisions to "modernize" PBM oversight

**The net effect:** The law Langworthy voted for makes Medicare drug negotiation *narrower* while removing PBM reforms that would have addressed the pricing "crisis" he describes.

Langworthy has not publicly addressed this contradiction while promoting PBM reform as the solution to drug pricing.

## The MAHA Caucus Contradiction

**December 30, 2024** — Ten days after voting for a bill stripped of PBM reform, Langworthy announced he was a founding member of the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) Caucus.

His press release stated:

> "Healthy food and access to quality medical care are essential for the long-term health of our communities... This Caucus will not only help ensure every community has better access to healthy food options but also **affordable, quality healthcare** so families can focus on living well and building strong futures."

The caucus claims to address "rising rates of chronic diseases" and support "underserved and rural communities."

**The contradiction:** Langworthy joined a caucus focused on "affordable healthcare" immediately after voting for a bill that:
* Had PBM reform stripped out (raising drug costs)
* Cut $911 billion from Medicaid (reducing healthcare access)
* Let ACA subsidies expire (raising premiums for 6,300+ NY-23 residents)

## In Plain Language

PBM reform has been stripped from legislation **three times** — each time at Trump's direction. Here's the pattern:

1. **Trump publicly supports reform** → Langworthy makes supportive statements
2. **Trump privately kills reform** → Langworthy says nothing
3. **Repeat**

When a standalone PBM reform bill was introduced in July 2025, Langworthy didn't cosponsor it for 82 days — until the exact day Trump launched "TrumpRx." He's not advocating for rural pharmacies; he's waiting for permission.

---

## Questions This Raises

1. Why did Langworthy not mention PBM reform being stripped when praising the American Relief Act in December 2024?

2. Why did Langworthy not mention PBM reform being stripped when praising OBBB in July 2025?

3. Why did Langworthy wait 82 days to cosponsor the PBM Reform Act—until the same day Trump launched TrumpRx?

4. If PBM reform is the urgent "healthcare emergency" Langworthy describes, why has he remained silent each time Trump killed it?
