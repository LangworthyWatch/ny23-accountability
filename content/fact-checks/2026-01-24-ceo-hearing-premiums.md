## Statement

**Source:** Facebook Post, January 24, 2026

> "Health insurance premiums keep rising despite trillions of taxpayer dollars pouring into the system... I asked each one directly: what are you doing—right now, specifically—to actually control costs for families? Working families deserve transparency, accountability, and a health care system that puts patients over profits."

Context: House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees joint hearings with insurance CEOs, January 22, 2026.

## The Contradiction

**The "rising premiums" Langworthy demanded insurers explain are directly attributable to legislative actions he supported:**

### Vote 1: OBBB (H.R. 1) — May 22, 2025: **YES**

- Did NOT extend enhanced ACA premium tax credits
- Cut $911 billion from Medicaid over 10 years
- Eliminated automatic reenrollment for subsidized enrollees
- Enhanced premium tax credits expired December 31, 2025

### Vote 2: H.R. 6703 (ACA Subsidy Extension) — January 8, 2026: **NO**

- Three-year extension of enhanced premium tax credits
- Passed 230-196 (17 Republicans joined all Democrats)
- **Langworthy voted against restoring the subsidies**
- Bill was forced to the floor via discharge petition after Speaker Johnson refused to schedule a vote

**Two weeks later:** Langworthy demanded insurers explain why premiums increased.

## The Premium Increases

**2026 Gross Premium Increases:**
- KFF: **26% average** (30% in Healthcare.gov states)
- Commonwealth Fund: **21.7% average**
- Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker: **18% median** proposed increase

**What Enrollees Actually Pay:**
- KFF: **114% average increase** in what previously subsidized enrollees pay
- Example: 60-year-old couple earning $85,000 → premiums increase **$22,600/year**
- 725,000 people with incomes 400-500% FPL lose subsidy eligibility entirely

**Why Premiums Rose — Insurers' Own Explanation:**
1. Rising underlying healthcare costs
2. **Subsidy expiration causing healthier enrollees to drop coverage** (adverse selection)
3. OBBB marketplace changes creating enrollment barriers

Insurers attributed approximately **4 percentage points** of premium increases directly to subsidy expiration.

## NY-23 Impact

**From verified Sen. Gillibrand estimates:**
- 6,300+ NY-23 residents use ACA marketplace
- Chautauqua County resident earning $65,000: premium increase of **$104.30/month** ($1,252/year)
- Family of four earning $130,000: premium increase of **$212.26/month** ($2,547/year)

**22 million** of the 24 million marketplace enrollees nationally received enhanced subsidies before expiration.

## Local Healthcare Consequences

### ECMC Layoffs (January 29, 2026)

Erie County Medical Center announced:
- **150 employees laid off** (3% of workforce)
- Management furloughs for one week
- Cause cited: "inadequate reimbursements from public and private payers, including Medicaid cuts"

NYSNA Statement: "In the midst of federal attacks on healthcare, our hospitals... should be looking for ways to protect safe, quality patient care."

### Kaleida Health Closures

- Millard Fillmore Surgery Center closing October 2025
- Buffalo Therapy Services closing
- DeGraff Medical Park closing
- 60+ employees impacted

### 1199 SEIU "Code Red"

- 8 Southern Tier hospitals at risk of closing
- 50,000 NY healthcare jobs threatened
- Hundreds bused to Albany to protest federal cuts

## The Pattern: Create the Problem, Blame Someone Else

| Date | What He Did | What He Said |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| May 2025 | Voted for subsidy expiration | — |
| Jan 8, 2026 | Voted against subsidy restoration | — |
| Jan 24, 2026 | — | Demanded insurers explain premium increases |

**The math:**
- Enhanced ACA subsidies cost approximately $25-30 billion/year
- OBBB added $4.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years (primarily tax cuts)
- Langworthy voted for the $4.5 trillion deficit increase while opposing the $25-30 billion that kept premiums affordable

---

## Questions This Raises

1. Does Langworthy acknowledge that the premium increases are partially caused by the subsidy expiration he voted for?
2. Why did he vote NO on H.R. 6703 on January 8, then demand insurers explain premium increases on January 24?
3. How does he reconcile calling subsidies "trillions of taxpayer dollars" with demanding insurers lower premiums that rose because those subsidies ended?
4. Is he aware that 6,300+ NY-23 residents face premium increases of $100-$212/month as a direct result of his votes?
