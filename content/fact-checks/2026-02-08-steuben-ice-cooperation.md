## Statement

**Source:** Local news coverage, 2025

Langworthy has positioned himself as a strong supporter of ICE enforcement and immigration crackdowns, framing these as necessary for public safety. However, when ICE cooperation agreements were proposed at the county level in Steuben County, residents voiced significant opposition.

## The Local Response

### Steuben County Residents Oppose ICE Cooperation

Local news coverage documented Steuben County residents publicly opposing proposed cooperation agreements between the county and federal immigration enforcement. The headline captured the sentiment directly: residents said **"no"** to ICE cooperation agreements.

Residents expressed fear about the impact of these agreements on their communities, with one article headline stating: **"We are all afraid."**

### Community Concerns

Reported concerns from Steuben County residents included:
- Fear of community disruption
- Impact on immigrant workers in agricultural and food processing industries
- Concerns about trust between local law enforcement and communities
- Potential chilling effect on residents seeking public services

## The Agriculture Connection

NY-23 is a heavily agricultural district. Immigration enforcement directly affects:

| Sector | Relevance |
|--------|-----------|
| Dairy farming | Dependent on immigrant labor |
| Agriculture | Seasonal and year-round workforce includes immigrants |
| Food processing | Significant immigrant workforce |
| Local economies | Small towns depend on working-age population |

Langworthy has visited dairy farms in the district (including a Mansfield dairy farm for a Farm Bill event) and positioned himself as a champion of agriculture. Immigration enforcement that disrupts agricultural labor directly conflicts with this agricultural advocacy.

---

## The Broader Pattern

This is one of several instances where Langworthy's national policy positions come into tension with local constituent interests:

| National Position | Local Impact |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Supports ICE enforcement | Steuben residents oppose cooperation agreements |
| Supports DOGE workforce cuts | Bath VA loses staff, Big Flats SSA office targeted |
| Votes for OBBBA (SNAP/Medicaid cuts) | Steuben County warns of $5M loss |
| Champions agriculture | Immigration enforcement threatens agricultural workforce |

---

## Questions This Raises

1. When constituents publicly oppose ICE cooperation agreements in his district, does Langworthy acknowledge their concerns?

2. How does Langworthy reconcile his support for aggressive immigration enforcement with the agricultural labor needs of NY-23's dairy and farming operations?

3. What specific impact would ICE cooperation agreements have on Steuben County's workforce and economy?

4. Has Langworthy met with agricultural employers in the district about how immigration enforcement affects their operations?

5. When residents express fear about federal enforcement policies, what is the representative's responsibility to address those concerns?

---

## Assessment

Local news coverage documents a gap between Langworthy's national immigration enforcement positions and the expressed concerns of his Steuben County constituents. Residents publicly opposing ICE cooperation agreements represents direct constituent feedback on a policy area where Langworthy has taken strong national positions.

The tension between supporting agricultural interests and supporting immigration enforcement that threatens agricultural labor is a documented policy contradiction, not a matter of opinion.

**Verdict: MISSING CONTEXT** — Langworthy's immigration enforcement advocacy lacks acknowledgment of constituent opposition and agricultural workforce impacts in his own district.
