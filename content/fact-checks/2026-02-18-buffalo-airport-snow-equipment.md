**On February 18, 2026, Rep. Langworthy held a press conference at Buffalo Niagara International Airport to announce $1,482,000 in federal funding for snow fighting equipment.** The earmark is legitimate — Langworthy's name appears as the sole House requester in the FY2026 THUD Community Project Funding table. However, Buffalo Niagara International Airport is located in Cheektowaga, Erie County — which is in **NY-26, represented by Rep. Tim Kennedy (D)**. Kennedy separately secured **$1,800,000** for the same airport in the same bill for airport vehicles and infrastructure. Langworthy's announcement did not mention Kennedy's earmark.

## Why This Matters for NY-23

NY-23 constituents use Buffalo Niagara International Airport, particularly those in the Erie County portions of the district (Newstead, Lancaster area). Federal investment in the airport's snow removal capacity benefits the broader region. The question is not whether the earmark is useful — it is — but whether the announcement provides the full picture of federal investment at the facility.

## The Two Earmarks in the Same Bill

The FY2026 THUD CPF table (P.L. 119-75, signed February 3, 2026) shows two entries for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority at Buffalo Niagara International Airport, appearing side by side:

| Requester | Project | Amount |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Langworthy (NY-23)** | Snow Fighting Equipment at BUF | **$1,482,000** |
| **Kennedy (NY-26)** | Airport Vehicles and Related Infrastructure at BUF | **$1,800,000** |

Combined, the airport received **$3,282,000** in congressional earmarks from this bill. Langworthy's press event announced only his portion.

*In plain language:* Congress directed $3.28 million total to Buffalo airport snow operations in this bill — $1.48 million through Langworthy and $1.8 million through Kennedy. Langworthy's press conference covered only his portion.

## The District Question

| Fact | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Airport location | Town of Cheektowaga, Erie County |
| Congressional district | **NY-26** (Tim Kennedy) |
| Langworthy's district | NY-23 — includes parts of Erie County but **not Cheektowaga** |
| Airport operator | Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA), a bi-county authority serving Erie and Niagara counties |

Members of Congress are not prohibited from requesting earmarks for projects outside their districts. The NFTA serves a regional constituency that includes NY-23 residents. Langworthy legitimately requested and secured this earmark through the appropriations process.

The documented facts: Langworthy held a press conference at a facility located in NY-26, announcing his $1.48 million earmark. Kennedy's $1.8 million earmark for the same airport in the same bill was not mentioned.

## Previously Documented Cases

This is the sixth documented instance of Langworthy announcing federal funding without acknowledging parallel efforts by other officeholders:

| Project | Langworthy Amount | Other Officeholder | Their Amount | Acknowledged? |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Town of Dix Water & Sewer | $1M | Schumer/Gillibrand | $1M (CDS) | **No** |
| Town of Elma Wastewater | $1M | Schumer/Gillibrand | $1M (CDS) | **No** |
| Town of Ellicott Water | $1M | Schumer/Gillibrand | $1M (CDS) | **No** |
| Allegany County Water | $1.25M | Schumer/Gillibrand | $1.25M (CDS) | **No** |
| Newstead Community Center | $5M | Schumer/Gillibrand | $5M (CDS) | **No** |
| **Buffalo Airport Snow Equipment** | **$1.48M** | **Kennedy (NY-26)** | **$1.8M** | **No** |

In every case, Langworthy's earmark is legitimate. In every case, the announcement omits parallel federal investment secured by other officeholders. In the Newstead case, the Senators' office credited Langworthy by name while Langworthy credited no one.

## Questions This Raises

1. **Langworthy held a press conference at a facility located in NY-26.** Did he coordinate with Rep. Kennedy's office, or was Kennedy's office aware of the event?

2. **Kennedy secured $1.8 million — more than Langworthy's $1.48 million — for the same airport in the same bill.** Why was this not mentioned at the press conference or in subsequent news coverage?

3. **The NFTA is a bi-county regional authority.** Is there a standard practice for how members from different districts coordinate announcements for shared regional facilities?
