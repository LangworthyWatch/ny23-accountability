## Why This Matters for NY-23

On January 10, 2026, Rep. Langworthy announced his Jamestown District Office would close indefinitely, citing "repeated credible threats and calls for violence." The closure cut off in-person constituent access for Chautauqua County residents. When the office reopened approximately one week later, the Post-Journal reported it coincided with protests in the area subsiding. A FOIL request to the City of Jamestown for all incident reports, police reports, calls for service, and records of threats or security concerns at the office between December 1, 2025 and February 23, 2026 returned one record — a burglar alarm — with no reports of threats, intimidation, protests, or security incidents.

## The Public Statements

**January 10, 2026 — Closure Announcement:**

Langworthy announced the Jamestown office at 2-6 East Second Street (Fenton Building, Room 208) would close indefinitely.

> "The safety of my staff and the constituents we serve is my top priority."

The announcement cited "repeated credible threats and calls for violence" and stated his office was "working closely with U.S. Capitol Police and local law enforcement."

**February 2026 — Reopening Interview (Post-Journal):**

After the office reopened, Langworthy provided additional details:

> "When someone says they want to do harm or threaten the people that work for me, I take that extremely seriously."

He described the threats as originating from social media and stated they were reported to Capitol Police. The Post-Journal reported the office reopened after "investigation concluded and protests in the area subsided."

> "We will continue to monitor these online comments, and any threats made to a member of my staff or myself...will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."

Langworthy's office stated that phones were answered and constituent communications continued remotely during the closure.

## What the Public Records Show

**FOIL Request:** Filed with the City of Jamestown, requesting all records related to threats, intimidation, protests, or security concerns at 2-6 East Second Street (Langworthy's office) for December 1, 2025 through February 23, 2026. Also requested all communications between Jamestown Police Department and U.S. Capitol Police or any federal law enforcement agency regarding the office.

**FOIL Response:** Fulfilled February 24, 2026. Cost: $0.50.

**Records returned: One (1)**

| Field | Record |
|-------|--------|
| Incident Number | 2026-00002972 |
| Date/Time | February 5, 2026, 1:19 PM |
| Location | 2 E 2nd St, Jamestown NY 14701 |

## The Gap Between the Claim and the Record

| Langworthy's Statement | Jamestown PD Records (FOIL) |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| "Repeated credible threats" | No threat reports filed with local police |
| "Calls for violence" | No incident reports for threats or intimidation |
| "Working closely with... local law enforcement" | No records of communication between JPD and Capitol Police or federal agencies |
| Office closed Jan 10 for safety | Only police record: burglar alarm Feb 5 — no employee on site |
| Reopened after "protests subsided" (Post-Journal) | No records of protests or demonstrations at the office |

## What This Does and Does Not Prove

**This FOIL response does not prove that no threats were made.** Threats made on social media would be investigated by Capitol Police or the FBI, not necessarily the Jamestown Police Department. Online threats against a federal officeholder's staff could bypass local law enforcement entirely.

**What it does establish:**

1. The Jamestown Police Department — the local law enforcement agency responsible for the office's physical location — has no records of threats, security incidents, or protests at Langworthy's office during the closure period.

2. Despite Langworthy stating he was "working closely with... local law enforcement," there are no records of communication between JPD and Capitol Police or any federal agency about the office.

3. The only police response to the office during the entire December–February period was a burglar alarm on February 5, at which point no employee was on site.

4. The Post-Journal's reporting that the office reopened after "protests in the area subsided" suggests the closure may have been related to constituent protests rather than — or in addition to — the stated "credible threats."

---

## Prior Incidents at the Office

Langworthy's office referenced two prior incidents during the reopening interview, though neither occurred during the closure period:

| Date | Incident | Location |
|------|----------|----------|
| February 2025 | Lock tampered with / vandalism | Jamestown office |
| Early February 2025 | Suspicious powder in package | Clarence office |

These incidents occurred approximately one year before the January 2026 closure and at a different office location (Clarence).

## Questions This Raises

1. Langworthy stated he was "working closely with local law enforcement." The Jamestown Police Department has no records of such coordination. Which local law enforcement agency was involved?

2. If the threats were made on social media and reported to Capitol Police, has Capitol Police confirmed receiving these reports? Have any arrests or prosecutions resulted?

3. The Post-Journal reported the office reopened after "protests in the area subsided." Was the closure related to constituent protests, social media threats, or both?

4. On February 5, 2026, police responded to a burglar alarm at the office and found no employee on site. Was the office still closed at that point, or had it reopened?

5. Langworthy stated that threats "will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law." Have any prosecutions been initiated?

## Pending Records

A separate FOIL request covering additional dates is pending ($4.50, indicating additional responsive records). This entry will be updated when those records are received.

## In Plain Language

On January 10, Langworthy closed his Jamestown office, saying it was due to "repeated credible threats and calls for violence." He said he was "working closely with local law enforcement."

A FOIL request to the City of Jamestown asked for every police report, incident report, call for service, and record of threats or security concerns at the office from December through February. The city returned one record: a burglar alarm on February 5. No one from Langworthy's office was there when police arrived.

There were no police reports of threats. No records of protests. No records of any communication between local police and Capitol Police.

It is possible that threats were made on social media and reported only to Capitol Police, bypassing local law enforcement. Langworthy has said the threats came from social media. But his statement that he was "working closely with local law enforcement" is not reflected in the local police records.

The Post-Journal reported the office reopened after "protests in the area subsided" — raising the question of whether the closure was prompted by constituent protests rather than the stated threats.

A second FOIL response with additional records is pending.
