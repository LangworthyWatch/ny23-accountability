## Documented Patterns

Based on analysis of 25+ fact-checks, these patterns emerge:

### Pattern 1: Create the Problem, Blame Someone Else
- Votes for subsidy expiration (May 2025) → votes against restoring them (Jan 2026) → demands insurers explain premium increases (Jan 2026)
- Farm Bill written without Democratic input → blames Democrats when it fails
- Supports Medicaid cuts → blames hospitals for closing

### Pattern 2: Take Credit for Opposition's Work
- Announces Biden-era infrastructure grants as "what strong leadership delivers"
- Claims USDA grants while supporting 31.7% agency staff cuts

### Pattern 3: Semantic Deception ("Technically True" = Functionally False)
- "No SNAP cuts" when $295B less will be spent and millions lose access
- "88% won't pay Social Security tax" when 64% already didn't pay
- "Remove illegal aliens from Medicaid" when they've been ineligible since 1996
- "Three bills passed committee" when only two actually did

### Pattern 4: Deflect to Biden/Democrats
Every constituent concern about Trump administration actions is met with "but Biden..."
- Hernandez pardon → Biden autopen "scandal"
- AP press restrictions → Biden social media pressure
- RFK Jr. opposition → Biden COVID failures

### Pattern 5: Form Letter Non-Responses
- Constituents opposing a policy receive praise for that policy
- Responses arrive after votes already cast
- Same letter sent to multiple constituents with tracking codes
