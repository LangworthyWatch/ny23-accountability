## Why This Matters for NY-23

The $10,000 SALT cap costs NY-23 middle-class households **$2,000-$5,000 annually** in higher federal taxes. Langworthy met with Trump to lobby for SALT relief as a "top priority," then voted for a tax package that included corporate tax cuts but no SALT relief. Constituents got the promise; corporations got the tax cut.

## Statement

**Source:** Public statements and Trump meeting, September 2025
**Reported by:** WGRZ Buffalo, Roll Call

Rep. Langworthy met with President Trump to lobby for restoration of the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, which disproportionately affects New York taxpayers.

> "New York families are being crushed by high taxes. We need to restore the SALT deduction to give our constituents relief."

He emphasized this was a top priority for his district, where the $10,000 SALT cap created by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly increased tax burdens.

## Context

### The SALT Cap Impact on NY-23

According to Tax Foundation analysis:
- **Average impact**: NY-23 households earning $75K-$200K pay $2,000-$5,000 more annually
- **High-tax areas**: Jamestown, Olean, Hornell residents particularly affected
- **State/local taxes**: New York's combined state and local taxes among highest nationally

### The Trade-Off Langworthy Made

The tax package he voted for prioritized:
1. **Corporate tax cuts**: Reduced rate from 21% to 15% (estimated $1.8 trillion cost over 10 years)
2. **High-income cuts**: Extended cuts that primarily benefit top earners
3. **No SALT relief**: Left $10,000 cap in place despite lobbying Trump about it

### What Constituents Said

WGRZ Buffalo interviewed NY-23 residents:
> "He told us SALT was his priority, then he voted for a bill that gave corporations billions while we're still capped at $10,000. That's not representing us."

Roll Call noted Langworthy was among several House Republicans who "publicly lobbied for SALT relief but voted for the package without it when leadership applied pressure."

## The Sequence

1. **Early September:** Langworthy meets with Trump, emphasizes SALT as "top priority"
2. **Mid-September:** Tax package negotiations include corporate cuts but minimal SALT relief
3. **Late September:** Langworthy votes YES on final package despite lack of SALT increase
4. **Outcome:** Corporations got tax cuts, NY-23 constituents still face $10K SALT cap

---

## By The Numbers

- **SALT cap cost to NY-23 households**: $2,000-$5,000/year average for middle/upper-middle class
- **Corporate tax cut benefit**: ~$1.8 trillion over 10 years, primarily to large corporations
- **SALT relief in package**: Minimal to none despite bipartisan support for $20K cap

## In Plain Language

The SALT deduction lets people deduct their state and local taxes from federal income. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capped this at $10,000 — hitting high-tax states like New York especially hard.

Langworthy:
1. Met with Trump to lobby for SALT relief
2. Called it a "top priority" for his district
3. Voted for a tax package that cut corporate taxes from 21% to 15%
4. That same package kept the $10,000 SALT cap unchanged

The corporate tax cut costs about $1.8 trillion over 10 years. A higher SALT cap would cost a fraction of that. Langworthy lobbied for one and voted for the other.
