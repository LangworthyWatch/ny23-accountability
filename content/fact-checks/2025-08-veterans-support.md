## Why This Matters for NY-23

The Bath VA Medical Center in Steuben County serves **33,000+ veterans** across seven counties. During the 44-day shutdown, VA operations were strained, benefits processing was delayed, and active duty military families went without paychecks. When the congressman who voted to start that shutdown attends Veterans Day ceremonies and says "we must honor our commitment" to veterans, the disconnect between words and actions directly affects constituents who served.

## Statement

**Source:** Public statements and social media, October-November 2025
**Reported by:** Multiple local news outlets

During the 44-day government shutdown, Rep. Langworthy consistently emphasized his support for veterans and military families:

> "I will always stand with our veterans. They served our country with honor, and we must honor our commitment to them."

On military families during the shutdown:
> "Our service members shouldn't be used as political pawns. They deserve better."

He also promoted his votes for veterans legislation and appeared at Veterans Day events in the district while the shutdown continued.

## Context

### Impact on NY-23 Veterans

**Military Families:**
- Fort Drum personnel affected (some NY-23 residents serve there)
- National Guard members faced delayed pay
- Veterans Day observed while service members went unpaid

**VA Services in District:**
- Bath VA Medical Center: Reduced operations during shutdown
- Vet Centers in Jamestown and Olean: Limited services
- Benefits processing: Severe delays for disability claims

### What Veterans Said

Olean Times Herald interviewed local veterans:
> "He shows up on Veterans Day to shake our hands, but his vote kept the government shut down while active duty troops weren't getting paid. That's not supporting veterans."

Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 527 in Hornell:
> "You can't claim to support the military and then vote to shut down their paychecks."

### The Budget Cuts Context

The same "One Big Beautiful Bill" that cut rural hospital funding (see related fact-check) also included provisions that veterans groups warned could:
- Reduce VA healthcare funding growth
- Limit veterans benefits cost-of-living adjustments
- Strain already-understaffed VA facilities

**Langworthy voted YES** on that bill despite these warnings.

4. **November 14:** Finally votes to reopen government after extracting concessions
5. **Throughout:** Posts social media about supporting veterans while voting contributed to their hardship

## In Plain Language

Here's the sequence:
1. **September 2025:** Langworthy votes NO on a funding bill that included full military and VA funding
2. **October-November:** The government shuts down for 44 days — the longest in U.S. history
3. **During shutdown:** Active duty troops go unpaid, VA benefits are delayed, Bath VA operates with reduced staff
4. **November 11:** Langworthy attends Veterans Day events, thanks veterans for their service
5. **November 14:** He finally votes to reopen — after extracting policy concessions

"Service members shouldn't be used as political pawns," he said. But using a shutdown to gain policy leverage is exactly what using people as pawns looks like.
