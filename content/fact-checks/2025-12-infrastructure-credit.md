## Statement

**Source:** Multiple Press Releases
**Reported by:** Langworthy.house.gov

Langworthy has announced multiple federal infrastructure grants for NY-23 communities, characterizing them as victories for the district and evidence of his advocacy.

**Examples:**

**June 2025:** "$3.8M federal grant for Finger Lakes Railway track rehabilitation... a major victory for the Southern Tier's transportation network and a testament to what strong leadership can deliver for rural communities."

**June 2024:** "$4.6 million in federal funding for water infrastructure improvements in Watkins Glen."

**Throughout 2024-2025:** Multiple USDA Rural Development grants for schools, water systems, and community facilities.

## The Pattern

**What Langworthy's announcements say:**
- Emphasize his role in "securing" or "delivering" funding
- Characterize as victories for "strong leadership"
- Rarely if ever mention the Biden administration
- Often omit the specific federal program providing the funding

**What the original grant sources say:**
- Biden-Harris administration programs
- Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funding
- American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding
- Regular federal agency competitive grants

## Case Study 1: Finger Lakes Railway

**Langworthy's announcement (June 2025):**
"Congressman Nick Langworthy announced $3,869,945 for Finger Lakes Railway track rehabilitation... a major victory for the Southern Tier's transportation network and a testament to what strong leadership can deliver for rural communities."

**FingerLakes1.com local news coverage (June 11, 2025):**
"Though the project was previously announced during the Biden administration, it had not been funded until now."

**What this reveals:**
- Project was initiated under Biden administration
- Langworthy announced it when funding came through
- Local outlet noted the timeline disconnect

---

## Case Study 2: Watkins Glen Water Infrastructure

**Langworthy's announcement (June 2024):**
Emphasized the $4.6 million grant for water system improvements, presented as delivering for the district.

**U.S. Economic Development Administration press release (June 25, 2024):**
"The Biden-Harris Administration knows that infrastructure is key to building an economy that works for all Americans... Today's announcement continues progress toward President Biden's goal of ensuring every American has access to clean drinking water."

**What Langworthy's version omitted:**
- Any mention of Biden-Harris administration
- The EDA grant program funding this
- The policy context for infrastructure investment

---

## Case Study 3: USDA Rural Development Grants

**Langworthy has announced multiple USDA grants:**
- Waverly Central School District: $2,750,113 (December 2023)
- Prattsburgh water infrastructure: $4.9M (2024)
- Various community facility grants throughout 2024-2025

**The context:**
USDA Rural Development is a federal agency. These are competitive federal grants, not congressional member-directed funding.

**Langworthy's simultaneous positions:**
- Announces USDA grants as evidence of his advocacy
- Supports Trump administration that eliminated 36% of USDA Rural Development staff in 2025
- Voted for budgets proposing 31.7% reduction in Rural Development staffing (FY26)

---

## The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Context

**November 2021:** Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)
- $550 billion in new infrastructure spending over 5 years
- Significant funding for rural broadband, water systems, transportation, energy
- Passed on bipartisan basis

**Langworthy's timeline:**
- Elected in 2022 (after IIJA passed)
- Did not vote on the bill
- Has consistently criticized Biden administration spending as "out of touch" and "reckless"

**But many grants he announces come from IIJA-funded programs:**
- Rural broadband expansion
- Water infrastructure improvements
- Transportation upgrades
- Energy grid modernization

---

## What This Looks Like to Constituents

**Example sequence:**

1. Biden administration creates grant program (IIJA, ARPA, etc.)
2. Local entity applies for competitive grant
3. Federal agency awards grant
4. Langworthy issues press release announcing the grant
5. Local news covers Langworthy's announcement
6. Constituents see Langworthy delivered funding
7. Constituents may not know Biden policies/programs funded it

**Net effect:** Credit for Biden-era infrastructure investment without acknowledging the policy source.

---

## The Broader Context

**Langworthy's rhetoric about Biden administration:**
- "Out of touch spending"
- "Released from Mars"
- "Reckless fiscal policy"
- Consistently critical of Biden economic policies

**Langworthy's practice:**
- Announces grants funded by Biden administration programs
- Characterizes as his own advocacy victories
- Rarely credits the federal programs enabling the funding

---

## Questions This Raises

1. If Langworthy opposes Biden administration spending policies, should he credit them when announcing grants from Biden-era programs?

2. When a local outlet reports a project was "previously announced during the Biden administration," does that change the characterization of "what strong leadership can deliver"?

3. How can constituents make informed decisions about which policies deliver for rural areas if credit is disconnected from policy source?

4. Is announcing USDA Rural Development grants while supporting 31.7% staff reductions to that agency consistent?

5. When Langworthy says he "secured" or "delivered" funding, does that mean:
   - He directed congressionally-mandated funding?
   - He advocated for a competitive grant application?
   - He announced a grant that would have been awarded regardless?
