**In his February 22, 2026 newsletter and a Facebook post from Waverly, Rep. Langworthy describes "the largest middle-class tax cut in history."** He is referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (P.L. 119-21), the budget reconciliation bill signed July 4, 2025. The claim is false on both counts. It is not the largest tax cut in American history by the standard measure, and independent analyses consistently show the majority of benefits flow to upper-income households, not the middle class.

## Why This Matters for NY-23

Tax policy has direct, measurable effects on household budgets across the district. Median household income in NY-23 counties ranges from roughly $47,000 (Olean) to $62,000 (Erie County portions) — placing most constituents squarely in the middle quintile where the tax cut's benefits are modest. If constituents are told they received the "largest middle-class tax cut in history," they may reasonably expect to see dramatic improvements in their after-tax income. The data does not support that expectation, and the same administration's tariff policies have offset much of the benefit for middle-income households.

## Statement

**Source:** Weekly newsletter, February 22, 2026:

> "Whether it's putting more money back in your pocket through the largest middle-class tax cut in history or bringing critical federal resources home to support local projects, my top priority is making sure Western New York and the Southern Tier have a strong voice and seat at the table in Washington."

**Source:** Facebook post from Waverly, NY (same week):

> "From the largest middle class tax cut in history, to unshackling American energy, and investing in critical projects across WNY and the Southern Tier — we have a lot to be proud of, and a lot more to do."

## Claim 1: "Largest Tax Cut in History"

**Verdict: FALSE**

The standard metric for comparing tax legislation across eras is revenue reduction as a percentage of GDP — because the economy grows over time, raw dollar comparisons do not account for economic growth. The Tax Foundation, a center-right tax policy organization, directly addressed this claim.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reduces federal revenue by approximately **1.4% of GDP** over the 10-year budget window. Five tax cuts since 1940 were larger:

| Legislation | Year | Revenue Reduction (% of GDP) |
|-------------|------|------------------------------|
| Economic Recovery Tax Act (Reagan) | 1981 | **2.89%** |
| Revenue Act | 1945 | ~2.7% |
| Revenue Act | 1948 | ~1.9% |
| Revenue Act (JFK/LBJ) | 1964 | ~1.6% |
| American Taxpayer Relief Act | 2012 | ~1.6% |
| **One Big Beautiful Bill Act** | **2025** | **~1.4%** |

Reagan's 1981 tax cut was roughly **twice as large** as the OBBBA as a share of GDP.

When the administration's tariffs are factored in — since tariffs are a tax on consumers — the net revenue reduction drops to approximately **0.73% of GDP**, making it only the **eighth-largest** tax change since 1940.

*In plain language:* In raw dollars, the OBBBA is large ($4.5 trillion over 10 years per the Joint Committee on Taxation). But that is because the economy is much larger today. Adjusted for the size of the economy — the standard method used by economists to compare across decades — it ranks sixth. Including tariffs, it ranks eighth.

## Claim 2: "Middle-Class Tax Cut"

**Verdict: FALSE**

Every major independent analysis finds the benefits are concentrated among upper-income households:

### Tax Policy Center (Brookings/Urban Institute)

| Income Group | Average Tax Cut | Share of Total Benefits |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Bottom quintile (under ~$34,600) | ~$150/year (0.8% of income) | ~2% |
| Middle quintile (~$67,000–$117,000) | Modest | ~10% |
| Top quintile ($217,000+) | ~$12,540/year (2.5% of income) | **~60%** |

Approximately **60% of the tax cut's benefits go to the top quintile**. Only about 10% flows to the middle fifth of Americans.

### Yale Budget Lab

- Only about **5% of the total tax cut** flows to the bottom two quintiles combined
- The tax provisions are "regressive: as a share of income, average tax cuts are larger for higher-income households"
- When combined with tariffs, the bottom 80% of households see **reduced** resources on average

### CBO (Congressional Budget Office)

- Resources **decrease** for households toward the bottom of the income distribution
- Resources **increase** for households in the middle and top
- By 2033, resources for the lowest decile decrease by about **4%** — driven by SNAP and Medicaid cuts in the same bill

### ITEP (Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy)

- Over **70% of net tax cuts** go to the richest fifth of Americans
- When combined with tariffs, all income groups except the **richest 5%** face a net tax increase in 2026

## The Tariff Offset: What the Full Picture Shows

The OBBBA cannot be evaluated in isolation because the same administration imposed tariffs that function as regressive consumption taxes. Yale Budget Lab found:

| Income Group | Net Effect (OBBBA + Tariffs) |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Bottom 10% | **-6.5% income** (worse off) |
| Bottom 40% | Tax cuts **fully offset** by tariffs |
| Median household | **~1% income reduction** |
| Top 10% | **+1.5% income** (better off) |

*In plain language:* For most NY-23 households — whose incomes fall in the bottom 80% nationally — the tax cut is partially or entirely canceled out by higher prices from tariffs on imported goods. A household in Olean earning $47,000 gets a modest tax cut but pays more for groceries, clothing, appliances, and building materials. A household earning $500,000 gets a substantial tax cut that tariffs barely dent.

## What the Bill Actually Contains

The OBBBA's major tax provisions include:

| Provision | Who Benefits Most |
|-----------|------------------|
| Permanent extension of TCJA individual rates | All brackets, but largest dollar savings at top |
| SALT cap raised from $10,000 to $40,000 | Primarily benefits homeowners in high-cost areas earning $200K–$500K |
| Estate/gift tax exemption permanently raised to $15 million | Benefits estates over $13.6 million (fewer than 0.1% of deaths) |
| Child Tax Credit increased to $2,200 | Broad benefit, but not refundable for lowest earners |
| No tax on tips/overtime | Limited duration, specific occupations |
| 100% bonus depreciation (permanent) | Businesses |

The estate tax provision alone — raising the exemption to $15 million per individual ($30 million per couple) — has zero relevance to middle-class households. It benefits approximately **4,000 estates per year** nationally.

## The Fiscal Cost

| Estimate Source | 10-Year Cost |
|----------------|-------------|
| Joint Committee on Taxation | $4.5 trillion net tax cuts |
| CBO | $4.1 trillion in additional borrowing through 2034 |
| CRFB (permanent basis) | $5.5+ trillion added to the debt through 2034 |

The annual deficit impact is approximately **$500 billion in 2026** and **$635 billion in 2027**.

*In plain language:* The tax cut is financed by borrowing. CBO projects the resulting debt accumulation will significantly increase annual net interest costs, adding fiscal pressure on future budgets.

## Questions This Raises

1. **Langworthy uses the "largest middle-class tax cut in history" line in both his newsletter and social media.** The Tax Foundation ranks the OBBBA sixth by the standard GDP-share metric. On what basis does Langworthy rank it first?

2. **If the tax cut primarily benefits upper-income households, why frame it as "middle-class"?** The CBO, Tax Policy Center, Yale Budget Lab, and ITEP all agree on the distributional skew. Which analysis supports the "middle-class" characterization?

3. **When tariffs are included, the bottom 80% of households are worse off on net.** Has Langworthy acknowledged the combined effect of the tax and trade policies he supports?

4. **The same bill that contains the tax cuts also cuts SNAP and Medicaid** — programs that directly serve NY-23 constituents. The CBO found resources *decrease* for the lowest-income households by 2033. How does Langworthy reconcile describing the package as a "middle-class tax cut" with the CBO's finding that it reduces resources for low-income households?
