## Statement

**Source:** Public statements to constituents, Late 2025
**Reported by:** Observer Today (Dunkirk-Fredonia), Local news coverage

Rep. Langworthy hailed the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) as a historic achievement:

> "One of the largest federal investments in our history to support rural healthcare"

He dismissed warnings that local hospitals might close as "all pure fiction," specifically rejecting concerns raised by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez about potential closures of Westfield Memorial and UPMC Jamestown hospitals in NY-23.

## Context

### The Sequence

1. Langworthy votes for budget bill with $155B in rural Medicaid cuts over 10 years
2. Rural hospitals face financial crisis from reduced federal funding
3. Congress passes $50B temporary Rural Health Transformation Program
4. Langworthy touts RHTP as "historic investment" without mentioning his vote caused the need for it

### Local Impact

According to healthcare analysts:
- **25 rural hospitals** in New York State (51%) are at risk of closure
- **16 hospitals** could close within 2-3 years without sustained funding
- **NY-23 facilities** including those Langworthy called "fiction" to worry about are among those at risk

### What Constituents Said

Observer Today (Dunkirk-Fredonia):
> "Not everyone would be willing to go out in the rain and tell us temporary funding for rural hospitals that offsets only one-third of permanent funding cuts is a win."

Governor Kathy Hochul's office analyzed that the GOP bill would lead to **$8 billion in cuts to New York's hospitals and health systems**.

## The Math

- **Permanent cuts** Langworthy voted for: -$155 billion over 10 years
- **Temporary relief** he celebrated: +$50 billion
- **Net impact**: -$105 billion to rural healthcare
