## Statement

**Source:** WGRZ Debate, Press Statements
**Reported by:** WGRZ Buffalo, Multiple Local News Outlets

**2025:** "My colleagues continue to peddle fear and misinformation about H.R. 1, falsely claiming it makes devastating cuts to SNAP. The truth is, not a single dollar is cut from benefits."

Langworthy has repeatedly defended the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1) against criticism that it cuts food assistance, stating that claims of SNAP reductions are "lies" and "fear-mongering."

---

## The Data

**Congressional Budget Office Analysis (May 2025):**

The CBO estimates H.R. 1 (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) would reduce SNAP spending by approximately **$295 billion over 2026-2034**.

This represents roughly a **30% reduction** in SNAP funding and would be **the largest cut to SNAP in nearly 30 years**.

---

## What the Bill Actually Does

**Major SNAP Changes in H.R. 1:**

1. **Limits USDA Authority to Adjust Thrifty Food Plan**
   - The Thrifty Food Plan determines SNAP benefit levels
   - Bill restricts USDA's ability to update benefit calculations for inflation and food costs
   - Result: Benefits do not keep pace with actual food prices

2. **Expands Work Requirements**
   - Extends work requirements to people aged 50-64 (currently 18-49)
   - Reduces exemptions for people caring for children or dealing with homelessness
   - Creates new reporting requirements that increase administrative burden

3. **Tightens Categorical Eligibility**
   - Restricts states' ability to provide "broad-based categorical eligibility"
   - Makes it harder for working families to qualify based on participation in other programs

---

## The Impact

**Center on Budget and Policy Priorities Analysis:**

- **40 million people** receive SNAP benefits, including **17 million children**
- The bill's restrictions would reduce benefits for tens of millions of recipients
- Work requirement expansions could cause **5.4 million people to lose benefits monthly** (Urban Institute estimate)

**Who would be affected:**
- Working families whose income fluctuates
- People aged 50-64 facing age discrimination in the job market
- Rural residents with limited job opportunities
- People caring for family members but not meeting narrow exemption criteria

---

## The Semantics vs. Reality

**Langworthy's defense appears to rely on a technical distinction:**

"Not a single dollar is cut from benefits" could technically mean:
- The maximum benefit amount doesn't decrease
- The Thrifty Food Plan calculation isn't directly reduced

**What actually happens:**
- Benefit levels don't keep pace with food cost increases (functional cut)
- Millions lose eligibility entirely (direct cut)
- Administrative barriers prevent eligible people from receiving benefits (access cut)

**Net result:** $295 billion less in SNAP spending over 10 years.

## The Rural Context

**NY-23 SNAP Statistics:**

According to New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA) data:
- Approximately **4 in 25 households** in NY-23 receive SNAP benefits
- Most recipients are children, elderly, or disabled
- Rural areas have higher rates of food insecurity than urban areas

### Steuben County: The Local Numbers

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| SNAP recipients (2022) | **11,459** |
| Share of population | **12.3%** — roughly 1 in 8 residents |
| County poverty rate | ~16% |
| Projected SNAP admin fund loss (2026-2027) | **Up to $5 million** (per WSKG) |
| Monthly benefit exposure during shutdown | **$2.2 million** |

**County Manager Jack Wheeler** confirmed at an August 7, 2025 Health and Human Services Committee meeting: *"the Big Beautiful Bill will result in Steuben County getting less money coming in from the federal SNAP program."*

**Steuben County Legislature Chair Kelly H. Fitzpatrick** sent a formal letter to Langworthy on October 30, 2025 — during a 43-day government shutdown — urging protection of SNAP and HEAP funding: *"Counties like Steuben are on the front lines of delivering these essential programs. SNAP and HEAP are lifelines for families, seniors, and individuals meeting their most basic needs — food and heat."*

Corning Democrat **Joe Tobia** criticized the OBBBA's Medicaid and SNAP provisions at the August 7 committee meeting. No public response from Langworthy to the county's concerns has been documented.

### OBBBA Administrative Cost Shift

Beyond benefit cuts, the OBBBA reduces the **federal SNAP administrative cost share from 50% to 25%** starting FY2027. This means counties like Steuben must either:
- Absorb the cost difference through local tax revenue
- Reduce the administrative capacity to process SNAP applications
- Or both — creating a compounding effect where fewer staff process applications for a program with more restrictive eligibility requirements

**Food Bank Impact:**

FeedMore WNY (serving Western New York) reported a **16% increase** in food assistance need in 2024. SNAP cuts would increase pressure on food banks that are already struggling to meet demand.

**Rural Employment Reality:**

NY-23's rural communities face:
- Seasonal agricultural employment
- Limited year-round job opportunities
- Geographic barriers to consistent employment
- Higher transportation costs for job access

Steuben County's high poverty rate, aging population, and seasonal employment patterns make work requirement compliance particularly difficult — CBO projects **2.4 million people nationally** will lose SNAP coverage in a typical month under expanded requirements. Expanded work requirements don't create jobs — they eliminate assistance for people unable to find work in areas with limited opportunities.

### State-Level Projections

Governor Hochul's office projects the OBBBA will cause:
- **1.5 million New Yorkers** to lose Medicaid coverage
- **300,000+ households** to lose SNAP benefits
- **$8 billion in annual cuts** to hospitals and health systems
- The Rockefeller Institute estimates the managed care tax restriction could cost New York **$1.5 billion annually** starting 2026

## What "No Cuts" Actually Means

**The CBO is clear: The bill reduces SNAP spending by $295 billion.**

This happens through:
- **Eligibility restrictions** → fewer people receive benefits
- **Benefit calculation limits** → benefits don't keep pace with food costs
- **Administrative barriers** → eligible people can't access benefits

**Is this a "cut"?**

If the government spends $295 billion less on SNAP over 10 years, and millions of people lose access to food assistance, most people would call that a cut—regardless of whether the maximum benefit level technically stays the same.

## Questions This Raises

1. How can Langworthy claim "not a single dollar is cut" when the CBO estimates $295 billion in reduced SNAP spending?

2. If millions of people lose SNAP benefits under expanded work requirements, is that not a cut to the program?

3. How will NY-23's rural food banks handle increased demand when federal food assistance is reduced by 30%?

4. In areas with limited employment opportunities, what happens to working-age adults who lose SNAP but can't find jobs?

5. Why does Langworthy characterize documented CBO analysis as "lies" and "fear-mongering"?
