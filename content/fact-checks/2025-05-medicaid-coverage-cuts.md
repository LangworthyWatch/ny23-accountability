## Statement

**Source:** Press Statement, May 15, 2025; FingerLakes1.com Column
**Reported by:** BTPM, FingerLakes1.com, WSKG

"Not a single person" among seniors, the disabled, or pregnant women would lose coverage under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Langworthy wrote: "For months, Democrat leaders in Washington and across the country have been pushing a false narrative: that Republicans are slashing Medicaid and targeting vulnerable Americans. It's a lie."

He stated the bill would "remove dead people, illegal immigrants, and able-bodied adults who refuse to work from the Medicaid rolls" while insisting "Medicaid was never meant to be a blank check."

## Context

While the bill does exempt seniors, disabled individuals, and pregnant women from new work requirements, the Congressional Budget Office projects millions in these protected categories will still lose coverage through other mechanisms in the bill:

1. **Dually eligible population:** 1.3 million people who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid—primarily seniors and people with disabilities—are projected to lose their Medicaid coverage
2. **Medicare Savings Programs:** 1.4 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries (over 10% of enrolled population) will lose MSP coverage, increasing out-of-pocket costs by at least $185/month
3. **Provider funding:** Cuts to hospital and provider reimbursements will reduce access even for those who remain technically eligible

**The Arc of the United States responded:** "It is nearly impossible to carve out a specific population, such as disabled people or elderly people, because the cuts to Medicaid funding will affect everyone due to hospital closures and health care workforce layoffs."

**Independent analyses:**
* KFF: $911 billion reduction in federal Medicaid spending over 10 years
* Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: Up to 15 million more uninsured by 2034
* PolitiFact: Rated claims that bill doesn't change Medicaid as **FALSE**
