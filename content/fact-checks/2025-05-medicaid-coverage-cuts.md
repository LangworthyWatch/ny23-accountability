## Why this matters in a rural district

In NY-23, Medicaid isn't a distant government program — it is the reason Cuba Memorial Hospital in Allegany County still has its doors open, why elderly residents in Schuyler County can afford nursing care, and how 36% of Chemung County accesses healthcare. When a representative says "not a single person" will lose coverage, the 10 million people CBO projects will lose insurance need to know whether that includes them.

## Statement

**Source:** Press Statement, May 15, 2025; FingerLakes1.com Column
**Reported by:** BTPM, FingerLakes1.com, WSKG

"Not a single person" among seniors, the disabled, or pregnant women would lose coverage under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Langworthy wrote: "For months, Democrat leaders in Washington and across the country have been pushing a false narrative: that Republicans are slashing Medicaid and targeting vulnerable Americans. It's a lie."

He stated the bill would "remove dead people, illegal immigrants, and able-bodied adults who refuse to work from the Medicaid rolls" while insisting "Medicaid was never meant to be a blank check."

## A. What the CBO Actually Found

*The Congressional Budget Office is nonpartisan. Its job is to project what legislation actually does. Here is what it projects for H.R. 1.*

---

### Coverage Losses

**July 2025 — Congressional Budget Office Score:**

| Category | Projected Impact by 2034 |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Total losing health insurance | **10 million people** |
| Losing Medicaid specifically | **7.5 million** → become uninsured |
| Dually eligible (seniors & disabled on both Medicare and Medicaid) | **1.3 million** lose Medicaid |
| Low-income Medicare beneficiaries losing MSP | **1.4 million** |
| Federal Medicaid spending reduction | **$911 billion** (KFF estimate) |

**Langworthy's claim exempts seniors, disabled, and pregnant women from new work requirements.** That is technically true. But work requirements are not the only mechanism in the bill:

1. **Dually eligible population:** 1.3 million people who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid — primarily seniors and people with disabilities — are projected to lose their Medicaid coverage through eligibility verification changes, not work requirements
2. **Medicare Savings Programs:** 1.4 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries (over 10% of enrolled population) will lose MSP coverage, increasing out-of-pocket costs by at least **$185/month**
3. **Provider funding:** Cuts to hospital and provider reimbursements will reduce access even for those who remain technically eligible

*In plain language: The bill exempts seniors from work requirements — but not from the eligibility changes, verification procedures, and provider cuts that actually cause most of the coverage losses. Being exempt from one mechanism doesn't protect you from the others.*

---

## B. What It Means for NY-23 Hospitals

*When Medicaid pays less, hospitals that depend on it either cut services, cut staff, or close. In rural counties, there's often only one hospital.*

---

### District Hospital Vulnerability

**The Arc of the United States:** "It is nearly impossible to carve out a specific population, such as disabled people or elderly people, because the cuts to Medicaid funding will affect everyone due to hospital closures and health care workforce layoffs."

NY-23 hospitals most dependent on Medicaid revenue:

| Hospital | County | Medicaid Dependency | Operating Margin |
|----------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Cuba Memorial | Allegany | **42%** | Negative |
| Arnot-Ogden | Chemung | **42%** | Negative |
| UPMC Chautauqua | Chautauqua | **37%** | **-17.4%** |
| Westfield Memorial | Chautauqua | High | **-59.1%** |

When a hospital gets 42% of its revenue from Medicaid and the federal government cuts Medicaid by $911 billion, the math is straightforward — even for people who never use Medicaid themselves.

*In plain language: If Cuba Memorial closes because Medicaid reimbursements drop, every resident of Allegany County loses their nearest hospital — including those on private insurance, Medicare, and no insurance at all. Medicaid cuts don't only affect Medicaid patients.*

---

## C. The "Not a Single Person" Claim

*Independent analyses contradict this claim directly.*

---

### What Independent Analysts Found

| Source | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **CBO** | 10 million lose health insurance; 7.5 million lose Medicaid |
| **KFF** | $911 billion reduction in federal Medicaid spending over 10 years |
| **Center on Budget and Policy Priorities** | Up to 15 million more uninsured by 2034 |
| **PolitiFact** | Rated claims that bill doesn't change Medicaid as **FALSE** |
| **Governor Hochul's office** | 1.5 million New Yorkers lose Medicaid; $8 billion in hospital cuts |

*In plain language: Every independent analysis — from CBO to KFF to PolitiFact — contradicts the claim that no one will lose coverage. The question is not whether people will lose Medicaid. The question is how many.*

---

## Assessment

Langworthy's claim that "not a single person" among protected categories will lose coverage relies on the work requirement exemption. But work requirements are one mechanism among several. The CBO projects 1.3 million dually eligible people — primarily seniors and disabled individuals — will lose Medicaid through other provisions in the same bill.

**Verdict: FALSE** — CBO projects 10 million will lose health insurance, including 1.3 million in the specific populations Langworthy claims are protected.
