## Statement

**Source:** WSKG Interview, November 14, 2025; Statement to WSKG, April 2025
**Reported by:** WSKG, WKBW

"I will not answer to a small and angry group of constituents that are constantly harping on this topic. I'm out in the community all the time. No one stops me on the street on this question."

Langworthy described grassroots constituent groups as "this nationally driven leftwing charade of fake town hall meetings being called together under mysterious, new organizations that all fall under the umbrella of the Indivisible network - a George Soros funded movement."

## The Record

**In-Person Town Halls Since Taking Office (January 2023):**
* **Documented: ZERO**

WSKG confirmed in November 2025: "He said he meets with his constituents 'all the time' and that he does not have in-person town halls."

**Telephone Town Halls:**
* Langworthy claims "monthly" calls reaching "100,000 phone numbers"
* The 100,000 figure refers to outbound automated dials, not actual participation
* Citizens for a Better Southern Tier alleges "half of his telephone town halls get canceled last minute"

## April 2025 "Empty Seat" Town Hall

**What happened:**
* Over 100 constituents gathered at United Steelworkers Local 1000 in Corning
* Empty chair left for Langworthy
* Attendees included Corning Mayor Bill Boland and residents from multiple NY-23 counties
* Organizers confirm Langworthy received formal invitation
* **Langworthy response:** None

**Organizer Dora Leland:** "We told him we had many, many constituents that would really appreciate having a meet and greet with him, especially since half of his telephone town halls get canceled last minute. And we got absolutely no response. Matter of fact, it was more like this...[crickets chirping]."

## The "Soros-Funded" Claim

**Langworthy's assertion:** Citizens for a Better Southern Tier is part of "the Indivisible network - a George Soros funded movement"

**The facts:**
* Citizens for a Better Southern Tier explicitly denies any Indivisible affiliation
* The group states it "does not receive any funding"
* Founded locally in 2017 by constituents frustrated with former Rep. Tom Reed
* Group statement: It is "an independent organization with no formal affiliations with other groups"

While Indivisible nationally has received funding from Open Society Foundations (approximately $7.6-9.5 million historically), Langworthy's claim conflates entirely separate organizations without evidence of any financial or organizational connection.

## Shutdown Transparency

**During the 43-day government shutdown (October-November 2025):**
* WKBW I-Team formally requested calendars from Western NY representatives
* **Rep. Tim Kennedy (D):** Complied, released daily meeting lists
* **Rep. Nick Langworthy (R):** "Outright refused to release his calendar" because members "are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act and will not be producing the documents requested"
* **Rep. Claudia Tenney (R):** No response
