## Statement

**Source:** Langworthy office statements, 2023-2026

Langworthy's office has stated he conducts regular constituent engagement, including:
- Monthly telephone town halls reaching "100,000+ phone numbers" per session
- Appointment-only office hours at district offices

> "I'm out in the community all the time. No one stops me on the street on this question."

## The Record: Zero In-Person Town Halls

**Langworthy has not held an in-person public town hall since taking office in January 2023**, according to reporting by WSKG, WGRZ, and the Post-Journal.

This is now **over three years** without a single public forum where constituents can ask questions in person.

## Timeline of Constituent Attempts

### March 2025: Chemung County

- Constituents packed the **county legislature chambers**
- Attendees asked: **"Where is Nick Langworthy?"**
- Residents demanded answers on Medicaid and SNAP cuts
- **Langworthy response:** Did not attend

### April 2025: Corning "Empty Seat" Town Hall

- **Over 100 constituents** gathered at United Steelworkers Local 1000 in Corning (Steuben County)
- Empty chair left for Langworthy
- Attendees included **Corning Mayor Bill Boland** and residents from multiple NY-23 counties
- Organizers confirm Langworthy received formal invitation
- **Langworthy response:** None

**Organizer Dora Leland:** "We told him we had many, many constituents that would really appreciate having a meet and greet with him, especially since half of his telephone town halls get canceled last minute. And we got absolutely no response."

### Blasdell (Erie County)

- Similar constituent-organized event held
- **Langworthy's response:** Characterized such gatherings as "this nationally driven leftwing charade of fake town hall meetings being called together under mysterious, new organizations that all fall under the umbrella of the Indivisible network - a George Soros funded movement."

---

## District Office Status

### Jamestown Office (Chautauqua County)
- **Closed temporarily in January 2026** after credible threats
- Status: Reopened with security measures

### Clarence Office (Erie County)
- **Evacuated in February 2025** after a suspicious package
- Status: Operational

### Elmira Office (Chemung County)
- **A planned district office in Elmira City Hall was abandoned**
- Leaves the district's **most populous urban center without a dedicated office**
- Chemung County currently has **no local Langworthy office**

## The "Soros-Funded" Claim

**Langworthy's assertion:** Citizens for a Better Southern Tier is part of "the Indivisible network - a George Soros funded movement"

**The facts:**
- Citizens for a Better Southern Tier **explicitly denies** any Indivisible affiliation
- The group states it **"does not receive any funding"**
- Founded locally in 2017 by constituents frustrated with former Rep. Tom Reed
- Group statement: It is "an independent organization with no formal affiliations with other groups"

**Verdict on claim:** NOT SUPPORTED — No evidence connects this local group to Soros or Indivisible funding.

---

## Telephone Town Halls: The Reality

Langworthy claims "monthly" telephone town halls reaching "100,000 phone numbers."

**What this means:**
- The 100,000 figure refers to **outbound automated dials**, not actual participation
- Telephone town halls are **not recorded or publicly posted**, per constituent reports
- They are **inaccessible to second-shift workers**
- They do not allow the sustained, visible exchange that in-person forums provide
- Citizens for a Better Southern Tier alleges **"half of his telephone town halls get canceled last minute"**

## Transparency During Shutdown

**During the 43-day government shutdown (October-November 2025):**

| Representative | Calendar Request Response |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Rep. Tim Kennedy (D) | Complied, released daily meeting lists |
| **Rep. Nick Langworthy (R)** | **"Outright refused"** — cited FOIA exemption |
| Rep. Claudia Tenney (R) | No response |

Langworthy's office stated members "are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act and will not be producing the documents requested."

---

## District Impact

Constituents across **all seven NY-23 counties** have limited mechanisms to directly challenge discrepancies between public statements and voting records.

| County | Office Status | Town Hall Access |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Chautauqua | Open (post-threat) | None |
| Erie | Open | None |
| Chemung | **No office** | None |
| Steuben | No dedicated office | None |
| Cattaraugus | No dedicated office | None |
| Allegany | No dedicated office | None |
| Schuyler | No dedicated office | None |

## Questions This Raises

1. Why has Langworthy not held a single in-person town hall in over three years?

2. Security threats are real, but they occurred in 2025-2026—what explains the absence of town halls in 2023 and 2024?

3. Why was the planned Elmira office abandoned, leaving Chemung County without representation?

4. If telephone town halls are adequate, why aren't they recorded and posted publicly?

5. When constituents organize their own forums, why characterize them as "Soros-funded" without evidence?

## Assessment

The claim that constituent engagement occurs through telephone town halls and office hours is **technically accurate**.

The claim that **no in-person public town hall has been held in over three years** is also accurate and is supported by multiple regional news outlets.

Security threats are documented and real, but they do not explain the absence of town halls **prior to those incidents** (2023-2024).

Whether telephone-only engagement constitutes adequate representation is a judgment call for constituents, but the **factual record is clear**.

**Verdict: FALSE** — Claims of robust constituent access are contradicted by zero in-person town halls, abandoned office plans, and characterization of constituent groups without evidence.
