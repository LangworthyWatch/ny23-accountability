## Childcare and Family Services

### HHS Funding Freeze — January 2026

**Programs Frozen for New York:**
- Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF)
- Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
- Social Services Block Grant (SSBG)

**Langworthy's Defense:**
Cited Minnesota fraud case to justify NY freeze — but Minnesota fraud involved a **different program** (state-run CCAP vs. federal Head Start).

**Impact on NY-23 Families:**
- Head Start programs serving working families
- Childcare assistance for low-income families
- No NY-specific fraud evidence cited

## Rural Communities

### Farm Policy

**Farm Bill Status:**
- Written without Democratic input
- Failed in committee
- Langworthy blamed Democrats for failure

**SNAP Impact:**
- $295 billion less spent on food assistance over 10 years
- Work requirements would cause millions to lose access
- Langworthy claims "no SNAP cuts" despite reduced spending

### Rural Hospital Access

**Medicaid Cuts Impact:**
- 1.3M+ dually eligible (Medicare + Medicaid) projected to lose Medicaid per CBO
- 8 Southern Tier hospitals at risk
- Rural hospitals depend heavily on Medicaid reimbursements

**Langworthy's Claim:**
> "Not a single person" among seniors and disabled will lose coverage

**Verdict:** MISLEADING — CBO projects 1.3M+ losses among dually eligible

## Tax Policy

### "No Tax on Tips/Overtime" — The Fine Print

Langworthy promotes these provisions as simple tax relief. Reality is more complex:

| Provision | What Langworthy Says | What the Law Actually Does |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| No Tax on Tips | Simple, universal | Capped at $25,000; phases out above $160K (single)/$320K (married) |
| No Tax on Overtime | Workers keep overtime | Requires FLSA coverage determination; employer reporting waived |
| Auto Loan Interest | Deduct car payments | Only "final assembly" US vehicles; phases out at $100K+ income |

**Expert Assessment (AEI):**
> "They are much more complicated than what your ordinary middle-class household is used to dealing with."
