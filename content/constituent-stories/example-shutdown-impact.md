## Background

I'm a single parent of two children in Olean. We rely on SNAP (food stamps) to supplement our grocery budget while I work full-time at a local retail store making $16/hour.

---

## What Happened

**September 2025:** Rep. Langworthy voted for a spending bill without ACA subsidies, which Senate Democrats rejected. Government shut down on October 1, 2025.

**October 15, 2025:** My SNAP benefits card stopped working at the grocery store. I had $200 in my account that should have been available.

**October 16-20, 2025:** I called Rep. Langworthy's office three times asking for help. Each time, staff said they'd "look into it" but I never heard back.

**October 25, 2025:** Local food bank was overwhelmed. I waited 3 hours in line to get basic groceries for my kids.

**November 14, 2025:** Shutdown ended after 44 days. My SNAP benefits resumed, but I had already maxed out my credit card buying groceries.

## Supporting Documentation

- Food bank visit: October 25, 2025 (documented by food bank)

## Impact

**Financial:**
- $680 in emergency grocery expenses on credit card
- Interest accumulating at 24.99% APR
- Missed car payment to afford food

**Emotional:**
- Stress of not knowing when benefits would resume
- Embarrassment explaining to my kids why we couldn't afford their usual food
- Anxiety about asking for help at food bank

**Community:**
- Our local food bank nearly ran out of supplies
- Many neighbors in same situation
- New York State had to spend $65 million in emergency food assistance

## The Contradiction

**What Rep. Langworthy Said** (WSKG Radio, November 14, 2025):
> "Governing means putting your country first... You keep the lights on in the government for the American people, and that's what responsible leadership looks like."

**What Rep. Langworthy Did:**
- Voted for the bill that triggered the shutdown (September 2025)
- Voted against bipartisan compromise to end shutdown earlier (failed by 1 vote, December 2025)
- Did not return my calls asking for help during the crisis

---

## Statement from Rep. Langworthy's Office

Multiple calls to the office went unreturned. As of publication, no response has been provided despite three documented attempts for assistance.
