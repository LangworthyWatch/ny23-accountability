## Purpose

This site documents publicly available statements and actions by New York's 23rd Congressional District representative using official government records and archived sources.

## Our Process

### 1. Source Collection
We monitor:
- Official congressional website press releases
- Official social media accounts
- Congress.gov voting records
- Floor statements and official remarks
- Established news sources
- FEC campaign finance filings
- CBO and federal agency analyses

### 2. Verification Standards
Every entry on this site must meet these criteria:

- **Primary sources only**: We link directly to congress.gov, official websites, and archived pages
- **Complete context**: Full quotes with dates and circumstances
- **Archived evidence**: All sources archived via Archive.org for permanence
- **Factual accuracy**: Claims verified against multiple official sources
- **No speculation**: We document what was said and done, not motives or intentions

### 3. What We Document

**Statements**: Press releases, social media posts, newsletters, floor speeches, and public remarks

**Actions**: Congressional votes, bill sponsorships, committee participation

**Comparisons**: Side-by-side presentation of statements and corresponding actions

**Patterns**: Recurring gaps between rhetoric and legislative record

### 4. What We Don't Do

- Make accusations of criminal conduct
- Speculate about motives or intentions
- Present opinion as fact
- Use anonymous or unverifiable sources
- Selectively edit quotes to change meaning

## Why This Site Exists: The Local Media Gap

### What Local Media HAS Covered

- **WSKG** has reported on the empty-seat town hall movement, constituent protests, and Medicaid impact analysis. It is the most consistent source of independent coverage in the district.
- **The Post-Journal** (Jamestown) conducts substantive interviews and publishes critical guest commentaries.
- **The Buffalo News** produced analysis of the OBBBA's impact on district hospitals.
- **WGRZ and MyTwinTiers** have covered security incidents, office closures, and election results.

### What Local Media Has NOT Covered

The following publicly available information has received **no examination** from any local news outlet:

| Topic | Public Record | Coverage |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Missed vote rate** | 3.9% — nearly double the House median of 2.0% (GovTrack) | None |
| **Environmental score** | 0% LCV score in 2024; 3% lifetime | None |
| **Campaign finance** | ~44% PAC dependency; energy-sector donor alignment | None |
| **Donor geography** | What percentage are NY-23 residents? | None |
| **Cost-transfer mechanism** | How federal cuts become county tax increases | None |

### The Pattern

Multiple local outlets publish Langworthy press releases **verbatim or with minimal editing**, particularly grant announcements.

No local newspaper editorial board has published a **formal performance evaluation** of Langworthy since he took office.

### Why This Matters

A citizen-run accountability site performing functions no professional newsroom in the district has undertaken is itself a finding about the state of local political journalism.

This site exists to fill that gap using the same public records any journalist could access.
