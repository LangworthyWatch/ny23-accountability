```

**Result:** By the time the constituent heard back, their input was meaningless — the bill had already passed the House, passed the Senate, and been signed into law.

### The Exchange

**Constituent's Message** — May 16, 2025

Constituent contacted Rep. Langworthy's office to express **opposition** to the Rescissions Act of 2025 (H.R.4), which would cut $9 billion from programs including USAID and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

*Auto-reply received same day:*
> "Your correspondence has been received, and we will reach out shortly with either a response, or a further inquiry, for casework."

**→ 75 DAYS PASS →**

**Langworthy's Response** — July 30, 2025 *(6 days after bill became law)*

> "Thank you for contacting me to express your opposition to the Recissions Act of 2025 (H.R.4). I appreciate the opportunity to respond."
>
> "I proudly supported H.R.4 when it passed the House on July 17, 2025. On July 24, 2025, President Trump signed this recissions package into law."
>
> "Although we do not see eye to eye on H.R.4, rest assured I will keep your thoughts regarding foreign aid and public media in mind as Congress works through the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations process."

### Key Quote

> "rest assured I will keep your thoughts... in mind"

**The problem:** The constituent's thoughts arrived *after* the vote. There was nothing to "keep in mind" — the decision was already final.

### What the Response Actually Said

**Langworthy's justification for voting YES:**

- Defended cuts as eliminating "waste, fraud, and abuse"
- Cited DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) findings
- Claimed taxpayer dollars were funding:
  - "Afghani opium farmers"
  - "Transgender studies on animals"
  - "DEI scholarships in Burma"
  - "Transgender operas in Colombia"
- Criticized NPR for having "87 registered Democrats in NPR's editorial staff, and not a single Republican"
- Accused public broadcasting of "documented left-wing bias"

**On the constituent's opposition:**
> "Although we do not see eye to eye on H.R.4, rest assured I will keep your thoughts regarding foreign aid and public media in mind as Congress works through the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations process."

### Questions This Raises

1. **Was the constituent's May 16 message seen before the July 17 vote?**
2. **If so, why did the response take until July 30?**
3. **If not, what's the point of constituent feedback?**
4. **How can citizens provide meaningful input if responses arrive after votes are cast?**
5. **What does "shortly" mean if it takes 75 days?**
