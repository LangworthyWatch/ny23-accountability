## Response from Rep. Langworthy's Office

**Response received:** July 30, 2025 (75+ days later)
**Type:** Form letter

### Key Points from Response:

**On the constituent's opposition:**
> "Although we do not see eye to eye on H.R.4, rest assured I will keep your thoughts regarding foreign aid and public media in mind as Congress works through the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations process."

**Langworthy's position:**
- Proudly supported H.R.4 when it passed the House on July 17, 2025
- Defended cuts as eliminating "waste, fraud, and abuse"
- Cited DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) findings
- Criticized NPR for having "87 registered Democrats in NPR's editorial staff, and not a single Republican"
- Accused public broadcasting of "documented left-wing bias"

## Analysis

### Response Type: Form Letter

This is a **form letter** that:
- Acknowledges the constituent's opposition but reaffirms Langworthy's vote in favor of the bill
- Does not address specific constituent concerns
- Provides standard talking points about DOGE, NPR bias, and wasteful spending
- Uses partisan language ("Democrat talking points," "propaganda for a political party")

### Timeline Issues

- **May 16, 2025:** Constituent contacts office opposing H.R.4
- **July 17, 2025:** H.R.4 passes House (Langworthy votes YES) — **62 days later, no response yet**
- **July 24, 2025:** President Trump signs H.R.4 into law — **69 days later, still no response**
- **July 30, 2025:** Response finally sent — **75+ days after initial contact**

**By the time the constituent received a response, the bill had already:**
1. Passed the House
2. Been signed into law by the President
3. Taken effect

The constituent's input was acknowledged only **after all legislative action was complete**, making the response purely informational rather than representative feedback that could influence a vote.

### Pattern Observed

The response:
- Came **after the vote**, not before
- Explained why Langworthy voted the way he did (already done)
- Promised to "keep your thoughts in mind" for future appropriations
- Did not indicate whether constituent input was considered before the July 17 vote

## Questions This Raises

1. Why did it take 75+ days to respond to a constituent's concern about pending legislation?

2. Was the constituent's opposition communicated to Rep. Langworthy before he voted on July 17, 2025?

3. If constituent input was received before the vote, how was it weighed against the decision to vote YES?

4. How can constituents provide meaningful input on legislation if responses come after votes are already cast?
