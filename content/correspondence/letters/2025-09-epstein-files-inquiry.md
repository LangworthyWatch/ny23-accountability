**Result:** Langworthy voted against immediate release, cosponsored an alternative bill, and 167+ days later, no documents have been released through either mechanism.

### The Exchange

**Constituent's Message** — August 2025

Constituent contacted Rep. Langworthy's office to express concerns about the Jeffrey Epstein case and transparency regarding related documents.

**→**

**Langworthy's Response** — September 4, 2025

> "I want to begin by stating that Jeffrey Epstein was a disgusting individual, and I support full transparency and accountability regarding the Epstein files. **I have never opposed the release of the documents** since Epstein's 2019 suicide..."
>
> "Unfortunately, Democrat members of the House Rules Committee chose to [politicize this] and on July 14, 2025, introduced a last-minute amendment related to the Epstein files... The Democrats' amendment did not meet this standard and, more importantly, **would not have led to the release of a single classified document.**"
>
> "That's why I am an original cosponsor of H.Res.589... Presently, **H.Res.589 awaits a vote on the House Floor** for further consideration."

### Fact-Check: His Claims vs. The Record

| Langworthy's Claim | The Record |
|--------------------|------------|
| "I have never opposed the release" | Voted NO on July 14 amendment to release files |
| Democratic amendment was a "political stunt" | Amendment was 47 words directing publication with victim protections |
| H.Res.589 is the real solution | Still hasn't received floor vote after 167+ days |
| Democratic amendment "would not have led to release" | It directed immediate publication; H.Res.589 has released nothing |

---

### The Core Contradiction

**His letter says:** "I have never opposed the release of the documents"

**His vote says:** NO on the July 14 amendment that would have released them

**The result:** 167+ days later, no documents released through either mechanism

### What Actually Happened on July 14, 2025

From the [Epstein Files fact-check](/fact-checks/2025-07-18-epstein-files-transparency/):

> Democrats proposed a simple, 47-word amendment: 'The Committee on the Judiciary is directed to publish online any records, documents, or communications in its possession related to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein (including any related to co-conspirators), ensuring appropriate redactions to protect victim identities.'
>
> **Langworthy voted NO.**
>
> Three days later, he cosponsored H.Res.589, a nearly identical resolution — but one that would require committee review before release, with no deadline specified.

**The key difference:**
- Democratic amendment: Direct publication with victim protections
- H.Res.589: Committee review process, no timeline, no guarantee of release

### This Is a Form Letter

### Questions This Raises

1. If Langworthy supports "full transparency" on Epstein files, why did he vote against the Democratic amendment to release them on July 14?

2. What specific language in the Democratic amendment would have "not led to the release of a single classified document"?

3. Why does H.Res.589, which Langworthy cosponsored on July 17, still not have a floor vote scheduled 167+ days later?

4. If the issue is truly about protecting victims (as stated), why did the Democratic amendment include "appropriate redactions to protect victim identities" but Langworthy still voted NO?

5. Is cosponsoring an alternative bill that never receives a vote functionally the same as blocking release?
