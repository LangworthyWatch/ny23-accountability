## Response from Rep. Langworthy's Office

**Response received:** September 4, 2025
**Type:** Automated form letter

### Evidence of Automated Response System

This email contains identical HTML tracking code found in all Langworthy office responses:
```html
<br><span style="color: white; margin-left: -10000px; position:absolute;
left: -9999999px; opacity: 0; visibility: hidden; display: none !important;"></span>
```

This hidden element is characteristic of mass email/constituent management systems, confirming this is a **templated, automated response** rather than a personalized reply.

### Key Points from Response:

**Langworthy's stated position:**
> "I want to begin by stating that Jeffrey Epstein was a disgusting individual, and I support full transparency and accountability regarding the Epstein files. I have never opposed the release of the documents since Epstein's 2019 suicide."

**On the House Rules Committee vote:**
> "Unfortunately, Democrat members of the House Rules Committee chose to do just that and on July 14, 2025, introduced a last-minute amendment related to the Epstein files to a rule governing consideration of three unrelated cryptocurrency bills."

**Langworthy's explanation for voting NO:**
- Claims the Democratic amendment was not "germane" to cryptocurrency legislation
- States the amendment "would not have led to the release of a single classified document"
- Calls Democratic action a "political stunt"

**Alternative bill:**
- Cosponsored H.Res.589 (resolution for public release of Epstein documents)
- Voted in support when it advanced out of House Rules Committee on July 17, 2025
- As of September 4, 2025: "H.Res.589 awaits a vote on the House Floor"

## Analysis

### Response Type: Form Letter

This is a **form letter** that provides Langworthy's standard explanation for his July 14, 2025 vote against releasing Epstein files.

### Context: What Actually Happened

**July 14, 2025 — House Rules Committee Vote**

The Democratic amendment to release Epstein files was voted down along party lines in the House Rules Committee. Rep. Langworthy, as a member of the Rules Committee, voted **NO** on releasing the documents.

**His stated reasons:**
1. Amendment wasn't "germane" to cryptocurrency bills
2. Wouldn't have released classified documents
3. Democrats were playing politics

**The contradiction documented on LangworthyWatch.org:**

From the [Epstein Files fact-check](/fact-checks/2025-07-18-epstein-files-transparency/):

> On July 14, 2025, Democrats proposed a simple, 47-word amendment: 'The Committee on the Judiciary is directed to publish online any records, documents, or communications in its possession related to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein (including any related to co-conspirators), ensuring appropriate redactions to protect victim identities.'
>
> **Langworthy voted NO.**
>
> Three days later, he cosponsored H.Res.589, a nearly identical resolution — but one that would require committee review before release, with no deadline specified.

**The key difference:**
- Democratic amendment: Direct publication with victim protections
- H.Res.589: Committee review process, no timeline, no guarantee of release

### Timeline

- **July 14, 2025:** Langworthy votes NO on Democrat amendment to release Epstein files
- **July 17, 2025:** Langworthy cosponsors H.Res.589 (alternative resolution)
- **August 2025:** Constituent contacts office about Epstein case
- **September 4, 2025:** Form letter sent explaining July vote
- **December 29, 2025:** H.Res.589 still has not received a floor vote

**Result:** 167+ days later, no Epstein documents have been released through either mechanism.

## Questions This Raises

1. If Langworthy supports "full transparency" on Epstein files, why did he vote against the Democratic amendment to release them on July 14?

2. What specific language in the Democratic amendment would have "not led to the release of a single classified document"?

3. Why does H.Res.589, which Langworthy cosponsored on July 17, still not have a floor vote scheduled 167+ days later?

4. If the issue is truly about protecting victims (as stated), why did the Democratic amendment include "appropriate redactions to protect victim identities" but Langworthy still voted NO?

5. Is cosponsoring an alternative bill that never receives a vote functionally the same as blocking release?
