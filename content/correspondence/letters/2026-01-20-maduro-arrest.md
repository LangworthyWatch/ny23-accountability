## Contact Information

**Date:** January 20-25, 2026
**Method:** Email via Langworthy.house.gov
**Topic:** Venezuela military operation / Maduro arrest
**Response Status:** Form letter (at least 4 variations documented)

---

## Langworthy's Response

At least **four variations** were sent depending on constituent position:

**Standard Version:**
> "As you may know, in 2020, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted Nicolas Maduro on charges of narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, and corruption. These charges detail how Maduro deliberately flooded our nation with cocaine, harming American communities and threatening our national security."

> "I fully support the President's actions and his clear message that the United States will hold criminal regimes accountable when they threaten our national security."

> "With Maduro now facing justice, the United States has achieved a major milestone in the fight against narco-terrorism and transnational crime."

**War Powers Version:**
> "While I understand your concerns regarding this operation, the President acted within his Article II constitutional authority to defend the nation."

---

## Form Letter Variations

| Variation | Sent To | Key Difference |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Standard** | Supporters | Full praise for operation |
| **Concerns** | Those with concerns | Acknowledges concerns, defends anyway |
| **War Powers** | Those citing Congress | Defers to Article II authority |
| **Military** | Those worried about troops | Cites constitutional authority |

All versions support the operation and invoke Article II presidential authority.

## The Hernandez Contrast

**Same period:** Langworthy sent letters defending/deflecting from Trump's pardon of Juan Orlando Hernandez.

| Figure | Crime | Outcome | Langworthy Position |
|--------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **Maduro** | Indicted: drug trafficking | Arrested | "Major milestone" |
| **Hernandez** | Convicted: 400 tons cocaine | Pardoned | "Constitutional authority" + pivot to Biden |

Both are accused/convicted of the same core crime: flooding America with cocaine.

---

## War Powers Question

A constituent specifically asked about Congress adopting a War Powers Resolution.

**Langworthy's response:**
> "While I understand your concerns regarding this operation, the President acted within his Article II constitutional authority to defend the nation."

**What this doesn't address:**
- The War Powers Act requires congressional authorization for extended military action
- Whether Langworthy believes Congress should exercise oversight
- The constituent's specific question about congressional action
