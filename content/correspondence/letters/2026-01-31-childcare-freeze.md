## Langworthy's Response

Two versions documented with slightly different language:

**Version 1 (longer):**
> "Thank you for contacting me regarding the Trump Administration's actions at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts on the temporary pause placed on grants while HHS reviews potential compliance issues within the Head Start and Early Head Start programs."

> "Minnesota and other states have experienced significant fraud in their childcare assistance programs—fraud that has diverted billions of taxpayer dollars away from families who genuinely need help."

**Version 2 (shorter):**
> "Thank you for contacting me regarding the Trump Administration's actions at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts on the temporary pause placed on grants while the agency reviews the programs."

## The Deflection: Minnesota Fraud

Both versions cite Minnesota fraud as justification for the freeze:

> "Minnesota and other states have experienced significant fraud in their childcare assistance programs—fraud that has diverted billions of taxpayer dollars away from families who genuinely need help."

**The Problem:**

| Issue | Minnesota Case | HHS Head Start Freeze |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Program** | State-run childcare assistance (CCDF/CCAP) | Federal Head Start |
| **Fraud Type** | Billing fraud by providers | No fraud alleged |
| **Perpetrators** | Providers submitted false claims | N/A |
| **Jurisdiction** | State administered | Federally administered |
| **Connection** | None | Used as justification anyway |

The Minnesota fraud case involved the **Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP)**, a state-administered program. Head Start is a **federally administered** program with different oversight structures.

## What the Response Does NOT Address

1. **Impact on NY-23 families** - No information about local Head Start programs affected
2. **Duration of freeze** - No timeline for resolution
3. **Evidence of fraud in NY programs** - None cited
4. **Whether Langworthy supports the freeze** - Deflects to Minnesota without stating position
