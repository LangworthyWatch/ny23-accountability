**Response Status:** Response received

## Constituent's Letter

A constituent contacted Rep. Langworthy to express support for extending health care premium tax credits (PTCs).

---

## Response from Rep. Langworthy's Office

Rep. Langworthy's response acknowledged concerns about healthcare costs and availability in the Southern Tier, stating the region is "medically underserved." He noted that New York health insurance rates increased 9.7% on average last year and are among the highest in the nation.

**Key Points from Response:**

- **Did not commit to supporting PTC extension** - Only stated he would "keep your thoughts in mind" if Congress considers legislation
- **Pivoted to tax legislation** - Highlighted his support for H.R. 1 (Working Families Tax Cuts Plan) which addresses different issues:
  - Reauthorizes Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
  - Eliminates taxes on overtime and tips
  - Expands Child Tax Credit and Standard Deduction
  - Increases SALT deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000
- **Acknowledged healthcare problems** - Noted NY ranks poorly in hospital safety and nursing home care

**What the Response Did NOT Address:**

- Whether he supports extending the ACA premium tax credits that expired at the end of 2025
- Specific actions he's taking to address healthcare affordability
- The impact of PTC expiration on NY-23 constituents

## Analysis

This appears to be a **form letter** that pivots away from the constituent's specific request (extending PTCs) to discuss unrelated tax legislation. While the response acknowledges healthcare cost concerns, it does not commit to supporting the ACA premium tax credit extension that the constituent specifically asked about.

The SALT deduction increase mentioned primarily benefits higher-income taxpayers and is unrelated to healthcare premium subsidies that help lower and middle-income families afford insurance.

**Key context:** In November 2025, Langworthy stated he wanted to find "an off-ramp on how to get off of these subsidies" and falsely claimed people earning $300,000-$400,000 were getting "free health care" through PTCs. People at those income levels receive no subsidy whatsoever.

**Impact on NY-23 if enhanced credits expire:**
- Single person earning $65,000: premiums increase **$104/month**
- Family of four earning $130,000: premiums increase **$212/month**
- Over 6,300 NY-23 residents enrolled in ACA marketplace
