## Langworthy's Response

**Tracking Code:** `[NWDM6G-DMY47]`

> "Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). I appreciate the opportunity to respond."

> "As you may know, ICE is a federal law enforcement agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responsible for arresting, detaining, and removing non-citizens. Additionally, ICE agents play a critical role in mitigating national security and public safety threats by investigating criminal and terrorist networks and combating the illicit trafficking of drugs, weapons, and money."

> "I strongly believe the recent tragedies involving DHS agents must be thoroughly examined to ensure all the facts are clear and accountability is upheld. I look forward to officials from DHS testifying before the House Homeland Security Committee on February 10, 2026, so Congress can conduct proper oversight and consider legislative changes."

**On body cameras:**
> "You may be interested to know that I proudly supported the Homeland Security Appropriations Act (H.R. 7147) when this legislation passed the House on January 22, 2026. H.R. 7147 would fully fund DHS, ensuring it has the resources needed to protect our homeland and respond to major natural disasters. Specifically, this legislation would strengthen accountability among DHS agents by providing $20 million to ensure that any agent conducting an immigration enforcement operation is equipped with body cameras, allowing for full transparency in all incidents."

**On Tom Homan:**
> "Alongside these efforts, we must also work to lower the temperature in Minnesota. I am encouraged that President Trump has sent Tom Homan – who has served under six Presidents, including Presidents Obama and Trump – to lead this effort and help restore safety to our streets."

## What This Response Does NOT Address

1. **Specific concerns about ICE tactics** - Generic description of ICE role
2. **The Minneapolis shootings** - Only vague reference to "recent tragedies"
3. **Whether Langworthy supports reforms** - Defers to committee hearings
4. **Constituent's actual concerns** - Standard form letter regardless of position

## The Body Camera Claim

Langworthy cites $20 million for body cameras in H.R. 7147 as evidence of supporting accountability.

**Context:**
- This came AFTER the Minneapolis shootings caused national outcry
- Democrats had been demanding body cameras as part of ICE reforms
- The funding was included in the bill that Democrats blocked pending broader reforms

## Form Letter Evidence

- Tracking code: `[NWDM6G-DMY47]`
