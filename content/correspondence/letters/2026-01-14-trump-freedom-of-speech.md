## Constituent's Letter

A constituent contacted Rep. Langworthy to express concerns about the Trump Administration and freedom of speech.

---

## Response from Rep. Langworthy's Office

Rep. Langworthy defended the Trump Administration's actions regarding press access while pivoting to criticize the Biden Administration.

**Key Points from Response:**

- **Defended limiting AP access** - Stated that actions limiting Associated Press from Oval Office events, Air Force One, and small press pools "are not unconstitutional"
- **Blamed Biden Administration** - Claimed Biden "pressured social media companies to remove content they disagreed with"
- **Claimed Trump expanded access** - Stated Trump Administration "expanded access to the White House Briefing Room for independent journalists, new media platforms, and politically focused podcasts"
- **Cited previous legislation** - Referenced support for H.R. 140 (Protecting Speech from Government Interference Act) which passed the House last Congress but was not brought to a Senate vote; has not been reintroduced in current Congress

**What the Response Did NOT Address:**

- Specific concerns the constituent raised about the Trump Administration
- Why the AP restrictions are appropriate
- Whether limiting mainstream press access while expanding access to "politically focused podcasts" serves the public interest

---

## Analysis

This is a **form letter** that defends administration actions rather than engaging with the constituent's concerns. The response:

1. **Dismisses concerns** - Rather than acknowledging legitimate free speech concerns, the response defends the administration's actions
2. **Whataboutism** - Pivots to criticizing the Biden Administration
3. **Selective framing** - Frames limiting traditional press access as acceptable while claiming expansion of access to "new media platforms"
4. **Cites irrelevant legislation** - H.R. 140 addressed government pressure on social media companies, not physical press pool access - a completely different issue

**The pivot is instructive:** The constituent raised concerns about press restrictions. Langworthy's response defends those restrictions as "not unconstitutional" and pivots to attacking Biden-era social media policies and citing legislation that addressed an unrelated topic.

**Notable:** The constituent expressed concerns about the Trump Administration and freedom of speech, but the response reads as a defense of administration policies rather than an acknowledgment of free speech principles that might apply equally to all administrations.
