## Langworthy's Response

**Tracking Code:** `[YRWKLY-7LYJ2]`

> "Recently, disturbing footage emerged from Minneapolis showing the aftermath of a violent confrontation between ICE officers and a rioter who weaponized her vehicle against federal law enforcement officers conducting an operation to arrest an illegal alien."

> "The individual, who is now in custody, chose to disrupt a lawful arrest by driving her vehicle into federal officers carrying out their duties."

> "This was a violent rioter who threatened the lives of law enforcement officers with her vehicle."

## The Facts: What Video Evidence Shows

**Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey statement:**
> Video evidence contradicts the claim that Good "weaponized her vehicle" or was a "violent rioter"

**What Actually Happened:**
- ICE agents were conducting operation in residential neighborhood
- Renee Good was a bystander/witness to the operation
- Agents fired into her vehicle
- Good sustained injuries requiring hospitalization
- Good was subsequently arrested and charged

**Key Contradiction:**
Langworthy's characterization of Good as a "violent rioter" who "weaponized her vehicle" is directly contradicted by video evidence cited by Minneapolis Mayor Frey.

## The Contrast: Alex Pretti Letter

On the **same day**, Langworthy sent a different letter regarding Alex Pretti, another civilian shot by CBP:

**In the Pretti letter:**
> "I also want to note that Secretary Noem's characterization of Alex Pretti as a 'domestic terrorist' were reprehensible and should not be tolerated."

**The Double Standard:**
| Victim | Official Characterization | Langworthy's Response |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Alex Pretti** | Noem: "domestic terrorist" | "Reprehensible and should not be tolerated" |
| **Renee Good** | Langworthy: "violent rioter" | Used this characterization himself |

Both victims were shot by federal agents. One receives defense against inflammatory labels; the other receives the inflammatory label from Langworthy directly.
