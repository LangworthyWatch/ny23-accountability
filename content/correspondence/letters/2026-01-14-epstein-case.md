## Constituent's Letter

A constituent contacted Rep. Langworthy to express concerns about the Jeffrey Epstein case.

---

## Response from Rep. Langworthy's Office

Rep. Langworthy expressed support for transparency and accountability regarding the Epstein files, stating he has "never opposed the release of the documents since Epstein's 2019 suicide."

**Key Points from Response:**

- **Supported the Epstein Files Transparency Act (H.R. 4405)** - Voted for legislation requiring DOJ to publish all unclassified records related to the Epstein investigation
- **Legislation signed into law** - President Trump signed H.R. 4405 on November 19, 2025
- **House Oversight Committee member** - As a member of this committee, claims releasing files responsibly is a "top priority"
- **Documents released** - States the committee has released approximately 65,000 pages of documents related to the investigation
- **Stated opposition to politicization** - Said the case "should never be politicized"

## Analysis

While this response cites specific legislative action (H.R. 4405), **it omits critical context** about how that vote came about.

**What the response claims:**
- "I have never opposed the release of the documents"
- "I proudly supported the Epstein Files Transparency Act (H.R. 4405)"

**What the record shows:**
- **July 2025:** Langworthy voted NO on a Democratic amendment to release the files
- **Sept-Nov 2025:** Langworthy did NOT sign the discharge petition that forced H.R. 4405 to a vote (only 4 Republicans signed: Massie, Greene, Boebert, Mace)
- **Sept 26, 2025:** Rep. Pat Ryan publicly called out Langworthy by name for refusing to sign
- **Nov 17, 2025:** Trump reversed his opposition to the bill
- **Nov 18, 2025:** Langworthy voted YES along with 426 others (passed 427-1)

The bill only reached a vote because Democrats and 4 Republican dissenters forced it over administration opposition - opposition that Langworthy did not defy.
