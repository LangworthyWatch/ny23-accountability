A constituent contacted Rep. Langworthy to express **opposition** to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

---

## Response from Rep. Langworthy's Office

Rep. Langworthy defended RFK Jr. and the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda rather than acknowledging the constituent's opposition.

**Key Points from Response:**

- **Defended RFK Jr. appointment** - Claimed MAHA agenda "received strong support from voters"
- **Promoted COVID-19 skepticism narratives** - Stated the pandemic "exposed serious shortcomings in our public health system including widespread misinformation from government sources regarding the virus's origin, vaccine efficacy, and transmission data"
- **Congressional MAHA Caucus member** - Rep. Langworthy is a member of this caucus
- **Cited unrelated legislation** - Highlighted support for H.R. 919 (Chronic Disease Flexible Coverage Act) which passed by voice vote on March 4, 2025, addressing employer-sponsored healthcare coverage for chronic disease management
- **Did not acknowledge constituent opposition** - Response reads as if the constituent supported RFK Jr.

---

## Analysis

This is a **form letter** that fails to acknowledge the constituent's stated opposition to RFK Jr.'s appointment. Instead, the response defends the appointment and promotes the MAHA agenda.

**Notable Issues:**

1. **Did not address constituent concerns** - The constituent opposed RFK Jr., but the response defends him
2. **Promoted vaccine skepticism narratives** - Claimed "widespread misinformation from government sources regarding...vaccine efficacy"
3. **Pivot to unrelated legislation** - H.R. 919 (Chronic Disease Flexible Coverage Act) is a bipartisan bill on chronic disease HSA coverage that has nothing to do with concerns about RFK Jr.'s leadership of HHS
4. **No acknowledgment of RFK Jr. controversies** - Did not address concerns about RFK Jr.'s history of vaccine skepticism, anti-science positions, or qualifications to lead HHS

**The closing is particularly notable:** Langworthy says he'll "keep your thoughts in mind" while working to "codify Secretary Kennedy's changes within HHS" - the opposite of what the constituent requested.

**This response exemplifies a form letter that does not engage with the constituent's actual position.**
