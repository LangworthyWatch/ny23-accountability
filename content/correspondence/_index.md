| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Letters Documented** | 7 constituent exchanges |
| **Average Response Time** | Varies: same-day to 75+ days |
| **Form Letters** | 7 of 7 (100%) |
| **Hidden Tracking Codes** | Present in all responses |
| **Pattern** | Responses often pivot away from constituent's question |

## Patterns Documented

### 1. Deflection and Pivoting
Responses frequently pivot away from the constituent's actual question:
- **Hernandez Pardon:** Asked about drug trafficker pardon → response pivoted to Biden autopen claims
- **Premium Tax Credits:** Asked about ACA subsidies → response pivoted to unrelated H.R.1 tax provisions
- **RFK Jr. Opposition:** Expressed opposition → response praised MAHA agenda

### 2. Form Letters with Tracking Codes
Every response contains:
- Identical HTML tracking codes (hidden `<span>` elements)
- Standard talking points
- Promise to "keep thoughts in mind" for future (unspecified) action
- Closing: *"My door is always open..."*

### 3. Variable Response Times
- **Same-day:** Hernandez pardon (pre-written form letter ready)
- **75+ days:** Rescissions Act (arrived after bill became law)

### 4. Zero In-Person Town Halls
Every letter promises accessibility, but no in-person town halls documented since January 2023.

## Documented Cases

### [Rescissions Act (H.R.4): Response Arrived 6 Days After Bill Became Law](/correspondence/letters/2025-05-rescissions-act-opposition/)

Constituent contacted office on May 16, 2025 opposing cuts to USAID and public broadcasting. Auto-reply promised response "shortly."

**Timeline:**
- May 16: Constituent writes opposing H.R.4
- July 17: Langworthy votes YES (62 days, no response)
- July 24: Trump signs into law (69 days, no response)
- July 30: Response finally arrives (75 days total)

**Result:** By the time the constituent heard back, the bill had already become law. Response promised to "keep your thoughts in mind" for future appropriations — but those thoughts arrived after the vote.

### [Epstein Files: Voted NO in July, YES in November—But September Letter Never Mentioned the Change](/correspondence/letters/2025-09-epstein-files-inquiry/)

Constituent asked about Epstein files transparency. Received form letter defending July 14 vote against releasing documents.

**Langworthy's claim (Sept 4):** "I have never opposed the release of the documents"

**The record:**
- July 14: Voted NO on amendment to release files
- September 4: Sent letter defending NO vote as "political stunt"
- November 18: Voted YES on nearly identical bill (H.R.4405) - passed 427-1
- November 19: Trump signed H.R.4405 into law
- Result: Files now being released, but September letter never mentioned he'd vote YES 10 weeks later
