## Patterns Documented

### 1. Responses Arrive After Votes
Both documented responses came after legislative action was complete:
- **Rescissions Act:** Response 6 days after bill signed into law
- **Epstein files:** Response defends vote already cast

### 2. Form Letters, Not Dialogue
Every response contains:
- Identical HTML tracking codes
- Standard talking points
- No indication constituent input was reviewed before vote
- Promise to "keep thoughts in mind" for future (unspecified) action

### 3. "My Door Is Always Open"
Every letter ends with: *"My door is always open, and I am honored to serve Western New York and the Southern Tier."*

Meanwhile: Zero in-person town halls since January 2023.

## Documented Cases

### [Rescissions Act (H.R.4): Response Arrived 6 Days After Bill Became Law](/correspondence/letters/2025-05-rescissions-act-opposition/)

Constituent contacted office on May 16, 2025 opposing cuts to USAID and public broadcasting. Auto-reply promised response "shortly."

**Timeline:**
- May 16: Constituent writes opposing H.R.4
- July 17: Langworthy votes YES (62 days, no response)
- July 24: Trump signs into law (69 days, no response)
- July 30: Response finally arrives (75 days total)

**Result:** By the time the constituent heard back, the bill had already become law. Response promised to "keep your thoughts in mind" for future appropriations — but those thoughts arrived after the vote.

### [Epstein Files: Voted NO in July, YES in November—But September Letter Never Mentioned the Change](/correspondence/letters/2025-09-epstein-files-inquiry/)

Constituent asked about Epstein files transparency. Received form letter defending July 14 vote against releasing documents.

**Langworthy's claim (Sept 4):** "I have never opposed the release of the documents"

**The record:**
- July 14: Voted NO on amendment to release files
- September 4: Sent letter defending NO vote as "political stunt"
- November 18: Voted YES on nearly identical bill (H.R.4405) - passed 427-1
- November 19: Trump signed H.R.4405 into law
- Result: Files now being released, but September letter never mentioned he'd vote YES 10 weeks later
