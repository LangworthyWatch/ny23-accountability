**Date:** December 30, 2025

## Purpose
This document provides specific updates to add to existing fact-checks based on claims in Langworthy's December 28, 2025 year-end newsletter.

## 1. Social Security Tax Fact-Check Update

**File:** `factcheck_social_security_tax.md`

**Add this section after the main content:**

### Year-End Newsletter Reference (December 2025)

Langworthy's December 28, 2025 newsletter continues to promote the Social Security tax provision without acknowledging its limitations:

**Newsletter claim:**  
Newsletter graphic lists "TAX CUTS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS" among 2025 accomplishments.

**What the newsletter omits:**
- It's a $6,000 deduction with income limits, not tax elimination
- 64% of seniors already paid no tax before this law
- Provision expires December 31, 2028 (3 years)
- Same bill cut $911 billion from Medicaid, affecting dually eligible seniors

The year-end summary presents this as a senior-friendly achievement while omitting that the same legislation significantly cut healthcare programs seniors depend on.

## 2. Rural Hospitals Fact-Check Update

**File:** Whichever rural hospitals fact-check is the consolidated version (merge #3 and #4 first)

**Add this section:**

### Year-End Newsletter: "$50 Billion Invested Into Rural Healthcare"

Langworthy's December 28, 2025 newsletter prominently features a graphic claiming:

> "$50 BILLION INVESTED INTO RURAL HEALTHCARE"

**The Reality:**

The Rural Hospital Tax Credit Program (RHTCP) in H.R. 1 provides $14 billion in tax credits over 10 years, not $50 billion. More importantly:

- RHTCP offsets only 37% of the $911B Medicaid cuts in the same bill
- NY-23 rural hospitals derive 50-75% of operating revenue from Medicaid
- Net effect: Massive cut to rural healthcare funding
- Tax credits ≠ direct investment

**What is the "$50 billion" figure?**

The newsletter does not cite a source for this number. Possible explanations:
1. Inflated estimate including projected future benefits
2. Includes unrelated programs beyond RHTCP
3. Marketing figure not based on actual appropriations

Regardless of the source, characterizing the RHTCP as a "$50B investment" while omitting the $911B in Medicaid cuts misrepresents the net impact on rural healthcare.

## 3. Correspondence Delays Fact-Check Update

**File:** `correspondence_redesign.md` (main correspondence tracking page)

**Add this to the "Patterns Documented" section:**

### Volume ≠ Timeliness or Quality

**Year-End Newsletter Claims (December 28, 2025):**

Langworthy's newsletter emphasizes volume of communications handled:
- 184,511 total incoming messages
- 137,224 emails
- 28,955 form submissions
- 18,332 phone calls

**What the numbers don't show:**
- **Response time:** Documented 75+ day delays
- **Timing:** Responses arriving after votes cast and bills signed
- **Personalization:** Form letters with tracking codes, not substantive replies
- **Effectiveness:** Promise to "keep thoughts in mind" after decisions already made

High message volume does not demonstrate:
- Timely responses
- Meaningful constituent engagement
- Input considered before votes
- Personalized attention to concerns

The newsletter presents volume as evidence of responsiveness while documented cases show systematic delays and form-letter responses that arrive too late to influence legislative action.

## 4. Farm Bill Fact-Check Update

**File:** `factcheck_farm_bill_victory.md`

**Add this section showing the pattern:**

### Pattern Repeats: Year-End Newsletter Claims

Langworthy's December 28, 2025 newsletter demonstrates the same pattern of premature legislative claims:

**Newsletter statement:**
> "Three of my bills were reported out of committee and are awaiting consideration on the House floor"

**The problem:**
Only TWO bills have actually passed committee. The Reliable Federal Infrastructure Act (H.R. 4690) has NOT been reported out of committee—it's still in the first stage of the legislative process since July 2025.

**This mirrors the 2024 Farm Bill situation:**

| Farm Bill 2024 | Energy Bills 2025 |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Claimed "major victory" after committee passage | Claims "three bills reported out" when only two passed |
| Said provisions were "secured" | Implies all three are "awaiting House floor" |
| Never mentioned bill needed floor vote | Doesn't mention floor votes aren't scheduled |
| Bill died without floor vote | Bills face low enactment probability (4-5%) |
| Blamed Democrats six months later | TBD |

**The lesson:** Committee passage ≠ legislative success. And in this case, one of the three bills hasn't even reached committee passage.

## 5. Infrastructure Credit-Taking Update

**File:** `factcheck_infrastructure_credit.md`

**Add this to the examples section:**

### Year-End Newsletter Pattern Continues

Langworthy's December 28, 2025 newsletter features a photo of him at a ribbon-cutting for "Investing in the Allegany County Cornell Cooperative Extension."

**The pattern:**
- Takes credit for "Fighting for Western New York and the Southern Tier"
- Announces "secured funding" for local projects
- Shows "Secured funding to prepare our students for the jobs of tomorrow"

**What's typically omitted:**
- Which federal program provided the funding
- Whether it's Biden-era infrastructure law funding
- Whether he voted for or against the program funding the project

This continues the documented pattern of announcing federal grants as personal accomplishments while omitting the administration and programs that made the funding available.

## 6. Create New Brief Entry: Casework Claims

**New file:** `factcheck_casework_claims.md`

This would be a shorter entry examining the "$36M recovered" claim with context about whether it represents exceptional or typical congressional performance. Need comparative data from other offices to fact-check this properly.

**Research needed:**
- Average casework recovery by congressional offices of similar district size
- Whether 1,323 cases resolved is high, typical, or low
- Industry standards for constituent services metrics

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority (Add immediately):**
1. ✅ Social Security update (directly addresses newsletter graphic)
2. ✅ Rural Healthcare "$50B" claim (most misleading claim in newsletter)
3. ✅ Farm Bill pattern comparison (shows repeated behavior)

**Medium Priority:**
4. ✅ Correspondence volume vs. quality
5. ✅ Infrastructure credit-taking photo

**Low Priority (Need more research):**
6. ⏸️ Casework claims (need comparative data)

---

## Archive Priority

The December 28, 2025 newsletter should be archived immediately:
- [ ] Archive newsletter PDF to archive.org
- [ ] Archive AM 1480 WLEA News coverage
- [ ] Save email headers with distribution information
- [ ] Archive any social media posts sharing the newsletter

This is a primary source document making multiple verifiable claims that contradict or omit key facts.
