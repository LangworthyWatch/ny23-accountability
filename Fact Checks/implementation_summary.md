# New Fact-Check Entries: Implementation Summary

**Created:** December 30, 2025  
**Total New Entries:** 6

---

## Overview

Six new comprehensive fact-check entries have been created focusing on topics that directly impact rural NY-23 constituents. These entries follow the established LangworthyWatch format and sourcing standards.

---

## New Entries Created

### 1. Immigration: "Removing Illegal Aliens from Medicaid"
**File:** `factcheck_medicaid_immigration.md`

**Key Finding:** Langworthy claims to "remove illegal aliens from Medicaid rolls" when federal law has prohibited their enrollment since 1996 (except Emergency Medicaid, which reimburses hospitals for legally-mandated emergency care).

**Strength:** Very Strong - directly contradicts federal statute
**Rural Impact:** High - misrepresents healthcare costs in communities struggling with medical access
**Primary Sources:** PRWORA (1996), CRS Report IF11912, FactCheck.org

**Related to existing coverage:** Medicaid cuts fact-check (documents $911B cuts to program)

---

### 2. SNAP Benefits: "Not a Single Dollar Cut"
**File:** `factcheck_snap_cuts.md`

**Key Finding:** Langworthy claims "not a single dollar is cut" from SNAP while CBO documents $295 billion in reductions over 10 years—the largest SNAP cut in nearly 30 years.

**Strength:** Very Strong - CBO-documented contradiction
**Rural Impact:** High - 4 in 25 NY-23 households receive SNAP; food banks already strained
**Primary Sources:** CBO analysis (May 2025), CBPP, Urban Institute, NY State OTDA data

**Related to existing coverage:** Part of broader OBBB impact documentation

---

### 3. Agriculture: Farm Workforce Modernization Act Silence
**File:** `factcheck_farm_workforce.md`

**Key Finding:** Despite representing agricultural district and claiming to "fight for farmers," Langworthy has not cosponsored the bipartisan Farm Workforce Modernization Act—the primary legislative solution to farm labor shortages supported by American Farm Bureau Federation and National Milk Producers Federation.

**Strength:** Strong - clear legislative record, organizational support documented
**Rural Impact:** High - NY-23 dairy and grape operations depend on immigrant labor
**Primary Sources:** Congress.gov cosponsor lists, AFBF statements, USDA labor data

**Related to existing coverage:** New topic area (agriculture/immigration intersection)

---

### 4. Social Security: "88% Will No Longer Pay Federal Tax"
**File:** `factcheck_social_security_tax.md`

**Key Finding:** Langworthy claims 88% of seniors "will no longer pay federal tax" on Social Security when: (a) 64% already paid no tax before the law, (b) it's a $6,000 deduction not elimination, (c) it expires in 2028, and (d) higher earners still pay some tax.

**Strength:** Strong - overstates benefit, omits key details
**Rural Impact:** High - misleads rural seniors about temporary provision while same bill cuts Medicaid they depend on
**Primary Sources:** SSA data, Towerpoint Wealth analysis, CBO, Tax Foundation

**Related to existing coverage:** OBBB comprehensive analysis

---

### 5. Farm Bill: "Victory" Claims When Bill Never Passed
**File:** `factcheck_farm_bill_victory.md`

**Key Finding:** Langworthy claimed "major victory" and that his six bills were "secured" when Farm Bill passed committee—but the bill never received a House floor vote, never became law, and all six provisions failed to be enacted. Later blamed Democrats despite Republican Speaker never scheduling the vote.

**Strength:** Strong - clear legislative record
**Rural Impact:** High - April 2024 frost destroyed 75% of Chautauqua grape crop; GRAPE Act never became law despite "victory" claims
**Primary Sources:** Congress.gov legislative record, Observer Today, Post-Journal

**Related to existing coverage:** New topic (agriculture policy)

---

### 6. Infrastructure: Credit-Taking Without Biden Attribution
**File:** `factcheck_infrastructure_credit.md`

**Key Finding:** Langworthy announces federal grants as evidence of his "strong leadership" while omitting that funding comes from Biden administration programs he criticizes. Local news explicitly noted Finger Lakes Railway project was "previously announced during the Biden administration."

**Strength:** Moderate - more about omission than false claim
**Rural Impact:** Medium - constituents deserve to know which policies deliver infrastructure
**Primary Sources:** Federal agency press releases, local news coverage, Langworthy announcements

**Related to existing coverage:** New pattern documentation
