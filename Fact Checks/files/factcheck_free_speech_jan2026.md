# Free Speech: Defending AP Restrictions by Citing Unrelated Previous Legislation
**January 20, 2026**

### Statement
**Source:** Constituent Letter Response, January 14, 2026

Constituent wrote expressing **concerns about the Trump Administration and freedom of speech**.

Langworthy's response defends White House restrictions on the Associated Press:
> "Actions taken by the Trump Administration to limit the Associated Press (AP) from attending certain Oval Office events, traveling on Air Force One, and joining small press pools are not unconstitutional."
>
> "Unlike the Biden Administration who pressured social media companies to remove content they disagreed with... President Trump has made no effort to silence the voices of everyday Americans."

### What H.R. 140 Actually Addressed

The Protecting Speech from Government Interference Act prohibited federal employees from using their authority to:
- Urge social media companies to remove speech or accounts
- Pressure companies to add warning labels
- Demand internal policy changes regarding content moderation

**Key point:** H.R. 140 addressed *government pressure on social media platforms*—not *physical access to the White House press pool*.

### The Pivot

**Constituent's concern:** Trump Administration and freedom of speech

**Langworthy's response:**
- Defended AP restrictions as "not unconstitutional"
- Attacked Biden administration's social media interactions
- Cited H.R. 140 from previous Congress (addressed different issue)
- Claimed Trump has "expanded access" to "podcasts and independent journalists"

### What the Response Defends

The Trump administration has:
- Restricted AP from Oval Office events
- Barred AP from Air Force One travel
- Excluded AP from press pools

Langworthy's framing:
> "President Trump has actually expanded access to the White House for politically focused podcasts and independent journalists—including from Barstool Sports, Flagrant, and The Free Press."

### Questions This Raises

1. Does restricting traditional press while expanding access to aligned media outlets raise viewpoint discrimination concerns?

2. H.R. 140 addressed social media pressure, not physical press access—how is it relevant to AP restrictions?

3. The constituent raised concerns about the current administration. Does defending those actions address the concern, or dismiss it?

4. Is "not unconstitutional" the standard for evaluating press access policies, or is there a broader press freedom question?
