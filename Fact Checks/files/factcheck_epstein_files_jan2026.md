### What the Letter Omits

**Langworthy's stated reason for not signing the petition** (Erie News Now, October 2025):
> "I wholeheartedly support justice and complete transparency for the Epstein victims, which is why, in addition to co-sponsoring and voting for the full release of grand jury testimony, I am working with my House Oversight Committee colleagues to conduct the most comprehensive investigation to date."

**The problem:** The Oversight Committee approach allowed leadership to delay indefinitely. The discharge petition actually forced a vote—over administration opposition that Langworthy did not defy.

### Fact-Check: His Claims vs. The Record

| Langworthy's Claim | The Record | Verdict |
|--------------------|------------|---------|
| "I have never opposed the release" | Voted NO on July 14 amendment; did NOT sign discharge petition | **MISLEADING** |
| "I proudly supported H.R. 4405" | Did NOT sign petition that forced the vote; voted YES only after Trump reversed | **MISSING CONTEXT** |
| "The Epstein case should never be politicized" | White House called the discharge petition "a hostile act to the administration" | **IRONIC** |

### Questions This Raises

1. If Langworthy "never opposed" release, why didn't he sign the discharge petition alongside Massie, Greene, Boebert, and Mace?

2. Did the White House pressure campaign influence his decision not to sign?

3. Does voting YES after Trump reversed course—when the bill was guaranteed to pass 427-1—constitute "proudly supporting" transparency?

4. Why does the letter not mention the discharge petition at all?
