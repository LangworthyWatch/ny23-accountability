# Legislative Cross-Reference Verification
**Date:** December 30, 2025  
**Purpose:** Verify all fact-checks remain accurate against recent congressional activity

---

## Verification Status: ✅ ALL FACT-CHECKS CURRENT

All six new fact-check entries have been cross-referenced with recent legislation and remain accurate. In several cases, recent developments make the fact-checks MORE relevant, not less.

---

## Individual Fact-Check Verification

### 1. Medicaid/Immigration: "Removing Illegal Aliens from Medicaid"
**Status:** ✅ ACCURATE AND MORE RELEVANT

**Fact-Check Claims:**
- Federal law prohibits undocumented immigrants from Medicaid since 1996 (PRWORA)
- Only exception is Emergency Medicaid (hospital reimbursement for legally-required emergency care)
- Langworthy's claim implies removing people already ineligible by law

**Recent Legislation Cross-Reference:**
- **H.R. 1 (OBBBA) signed July 2025** actually restricted LAWFULLY PRESENT immigrants' access to Medicaid/Medicare/ACA subsidies
- **CMS increased oversight** (May 27, 2025) on states using federal Medicaid funding for undocumented immigrants
- **Federal law unchanged:** Undocumented immigrants remain ineligible for Medicaid except Emergency Medicaid
- **American Immigration Council (Nov 19, 2025):** "Undocumented immigrants do not have access to federally funded healthcare coverage, including Medicaid, Medicare, or CHIP"
- **Multiple fact-checking organizations** (Georgetown CCF, NILC, Commonwealth Fund) published October 2025 articles confirming undocumented immigrants remain ineligible

**Verification Result:**
The fact-check is **100% accurate**. The claim to "remove illegal aliens from Medicaid" remains false because they were never eligible. Recent OBBBA changes affected lawfully present immigrants, NOT undocumented immigrants.

**Sources Consulted:**
- HealthInsurance.org (Oct 2, 2025)
- Commonwealth Fund (Oct 15, 2025)
- American Immigration Council (Nov 19, 2025)
- NILC (Oct 2, 2025; Oct 31, 2025)

### 2. SNAP: "Not a Single Dollar Cut" vs. $295B in Reductions
**Status:** ✅ ACCURATE AND HIGHLY RELEVANT - CUTS NOW BEING IMPLEMENTED

**Fact-Check Claims:**
- Langworthy claimed "not a single dollar is cut from SNAP benefits"
- CBO documented $295 billion in cuts (some sources say $186-220 billion depending on calculation method)
- Largest SNAP cut in history
- Work requirements expanded, benefit calculations restricted

**Recent Legislation Cross-Reference:**
- **H.R. 1 (OBBBA) signed July 2025** - SNAP cuts are now LAW
- **Implementation began December 1, 2025** - work requirements for ages 55-64 now in effect
- **NPR (Dec 1, 2025):** "Republicans in Congress passed over the summer... the deepest cuts in history to the program"
- **The Hill (Dec 27, 2025):** "$186 billion, the largest cut in the program's history"
- **CBO estimates:** Cuts range from $186B-$295B depending on provisions counted
- **CBPP (May 28, 2025):** "Proposes Deepest SNAP Cut in History"
- **Urban Institute:** 22.3 million families will lose some or all SNAP benefits
- **Government shutdown (Oct-Nov 2025)** temporarily stopped SNAP payments, demonstrating program's vulnerability

**Current Status:**
- Work requirements for 55-64 year olds: **IN EFFECT as of Dec 1, 2025**
- Veterans exemption: **REMOVED**
- Homelessness exemption: **REMOVED**
- State cost-sharing begins: **Oct 1, 2027** (states preparing now)
- Thrifty Food Plan updates: **RESTRICTED**

**Verification Result:**
The fact-check is **completely accurate** and now even MORE relevant as cuts are being implemented. Multiple sources from December 2025 confirm the cuts are happening and affecting millions of people.

**Sources Consulted:**
- NPR (Dec 1, 2025; Oct 28, 2025)
- The Hill (Dec 27, 2025)

- Langworthy is NOT a cosponsor
- Bill has bipartisan support from American Farm Bureau Federation, National Milk Producers Federation

### 4. Social Security: "88% Will No Longer Pay Federal Tax"
**Status:** ✅ ACCURATE - PROVISION NOW LAW

**Fact-Check Claims:**
- Langworthy claimed "88% of seniors will no longer pay federal tax on Social Security benefits"
- Actually: $6,000 deduction (not elimination) for seniors 65+ with income limits
- 64% of seniors already paid no tax before this law
- Provision expires December 31, 2028
- Same bill cuts $911B from Medicaid affecting dually eligible seniors

**Recent Legislation Cross-Reference:**
- **H.R. 1 (OBBBA) signed July 2025** - Social Security deduction is now law
- **Effective:** Tax years 2026-2028 (expires Dec 31, 2028)
- **Income limits confirmed:**
  - Single: Under $75,000
  - Married: Under $150,000
- **Multiple sources confirm:**
  - Towerpoint Wealth: "significant portion of retirees will still face a taxable amount"
  - Newsweek: Analyzed provision, confirmed it's not full elimination
  - Tax Foundation: Confirms 88% figure refers to "some benefit" not "no tax"

**Current Status:**
- Provision is LAW as of July 2025
- Takes effect for 2026 tax year
- Will expire after 2028 tax year unless extended
- No legislation introduced to make it permanent

**Verification Result:**
The fact-check is **accurate**. The provision is now law, and its limitations (temporary, income-limited, deduction not elimination) remain as described. The fact-check's critique of the "88% will no longer pay tax" language is validated.

**Sources Consulted:**
- Langworthy press release (July 11, 2025)
- Towerpoint Wealth analysis (2025)
- Newsweek analysis (2025)
- Tax Foundation
- Public Law 119-21 (OBBBA)
- CBO scoring

### 5. Farm Bill: "Victory" Claims When Bill Never Passed
**Status:** ✅ ACCURATE - NO NEW FARM BILL PASSED

**Fact-Check Claims:**
- Langworthy claimed "major victory" and his bills were "secured" after May 2024 committee passage
- Farm Bill never received House floor vote
- All six Langworthy provisions never became law
- 2024 Farm Bill died when 118th Congress ended Jan 3, 2025
- Langworthy blamed Democrats despite Republican Speaker never scheduling vote

**Recent Legislation Cross-Reference:**
- **2024 Farm Bill (H.R. 8467):**
  - Committee passage: May 23, 2024 (33-21)
  - Floor vote: **NEVER HAPPENED**
  - Status: **DIED when 118th Congress ended**
  
- **2025 Farm Bill Status:**
  - Current Farm Bill (2018) extended through **September 30, 2025**
  - New Farm Bill **NOT YET PASSED** in 119th Congress
  - Langworthy's bills from 118th Congress **NOT AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED**

- **Langworthy's January 10, 2025 press release:**
  - Reintroduced seven agriculture bills for 119th Congress
  - Statement: "Six of the seven bills were previously introduced... and all appeared in the base text of the House Agriculture Committee's 2018 [NOTE: Should be 2024] Farm Bill that was reported out of committee, but **did not receive a vote by the full House**"
  - This press release **confirms** the fact-check's accuracy

**April 2024 Frost Impact:**
- 75% of Chautauqua County grape crop destroyed
- GRAPE Act (which would have provided crop insurance) never became law
- Growers received NO federal relief from GRAPE Act provisions

**Verification Result:**
The fact-check is **completely accurate** and Langworthy's own January 2025 press release confirms the Farm Bill never received a floor vote. The provisions he claimed were "secured" never became law.

**Sources Consulted:**
- Congress.gov H.R. 8467 legislative record
- Langworthy press releases (May 17, 24, 2024; Jan 10, 2025)
- Congressional Research Service
- Observer Today
- Post-Journal

### 6. Infrastructure: Credit-Taking Without Biden Attribution
**Status:** ✅ ACCURATE AND ONGOING PATTERN

**Fact-Check Claims:**
- Langworthy announces federal grants as evidence of his "strong leadership"
- Omits that funding comes from Biden administration programs
- Local news explicitly noted projects were "previously announced during the Biden administration"
- Pattern across multiple grants

**Recent Legislation Cross-Reference:**
- **Finger Lakes Railway grant ($3.8M):** Announced June 2025
  - FingerLakes1.com (June 11, 2025): "Though the project was previously announced during the Biden administration, it had not been funded until now"
  - Confirms fact-check's documentation of attribution omission

- **Watkins Glen water infrastructure ($4.6M):** Announced June 2024
  - EDA press release (June 25, 2024): "The Biden-Harris Administration knows that infrastructure is key to building an economy that works for all Americans"
  - Langworthy's announcement omitted Biden-Harris attribution

- **Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA):**
  - Passed November 2021 (before Langworthy took office)
  - Funds many programs Langworthy announces grants from
  - Langworthy has consistently criticized Biden spending while announcing Biden-funded grants

**Current Relevance:**
Pattern continues into 2025 with multiple grant announcements. The practice of announcing federal grants without crediting the administration funding them remains ongoing.

**Verification Result:**
The fact-check is **accurate**. Local news coverage from June 2025 explicitly confirms one of the specific examples cited, and the pattern of grant announcements without proper attribution continues.

**Sources Consulted:**
- Langworthy press releases (multiple 2024-2025)
- FingerLakes1.com (June 11, 2025)
- EDA press release (June 25, 2024)
- Federal grant announcements
- IIJA funding documentation

## Additional Findings

### SNAP Cuts Are Being Implemented NOW
The SNAP fact-check is particularly timely:
- Work requirements for ages 55-64 took effect **December 1, 2025**
- Government shutdown temporarily stopped SNAP payments October-November 2025
- Multiple sources from **December 2025** confirm largest SNAP cut in history
- 22.3 million families affected
- States already enforcing new rules

### Medicaid Changes Affect Lawfully Present Immigrants
Recent research reveals H.R. 1 (OBBBA) actually:
- Restricts coverage for **lawfully present immigrants** (refugees, asylees, etc.)
- **Does NOT change** undocumented immigrants' ineligibility (they were already barred)
- This makes Langworthy's claim to "remove illegal aliens from Medicaid" even more misleading
- 1.4 million **lawfully present** immigrants losing coverage (CBO estimate)

### Farm Bill Confirmation
Langworthy's own January 10, 2025 press release confirms the fact-check:
- He states the bills "appeared in the base text" of Farm Bill
- Acknowledges it "did not receive a vote by the full House"
- Reintroduced bills for 119th Congress (proving they never became law)

## Recommended Updates to Fact-Checks

### Minor Clarifications (Optional)

**SNAP Fact-Check:**
Consider adding note that work requirements **took effect December 1, 2025** to show immediate real-world impact.

**Medicaid Fact-Check:**
Consider adding note that H.R. 1 (OBBBA) actually restricted **lawfully present immigrants**, further demonstrating that undocumented immigrants were never eligible.

**Social Security Fact-Check:**
Provision is now law and effective for tax years 2026-2028. Can update language from "would" to "does."

### No Changes Needed
All fact-checks remain factually accurate and require no corrections based on recent legislation.
