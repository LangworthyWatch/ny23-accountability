## Immigration: Claiming to "Remove Illegal Aliens from Medicaid" When Federal Law Already Prohibits Their Enrollment
**December 30, 2025**

### Statement
**Source:** Press Release, House Energy and Commerce Committee Reconciliation Bill  
**Reported by:** Langworthy.house.gov, Wellsville Sun

**May 12, 2025:** "We are also removing illegal aliens from the Medicaid rolls. American taxpayers should never be forced to subsidize healthcare for those who have broken our immigration laws."

**May 14-15, 2025 (Wellsville Sun op-ed):** Langworthy repeated this claim, stating the reconciliation bill would "remove dead people, illegal immigrants, and able-bodied adults who refuse to work from the Medicaid rolls."

### The Law

**Federal law has prohibited undocumented immigrants from Medicaid eligibility since 1996.**

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 established that people living in the U.S. without legal status are **not eligible** to receive Medicaid benefits, with one exception: Emergency Medicaid.

**What Emergency Medicaid Actually Is:**
- Reimburses hospitals for **legally-mandated emergency care** under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)
- Does NOT provide insurance coverage to undocumented immigrants
- Does NOT give undocumented immigrants "free healthcare"
- Hospitals are required by federal law to stabilize emergency patients regardless of ability to pay or immigration status

**Per FactCheck.org (May 2025):**
"People living in the U.S. illegally are not eligible to receive Medicaid benefits other than for emergency medical services."

**Congressional Research Service (Report IF11912):**
"Noncitizens who are not lawfully present are generally not eligible for Medicaid, with limited exceptions for emergency services."

### The Problem

**The claim implies removing people who are already ineligible by law.**

If undocumented immigrants cannot enroll in Medicaid except for emergency care that hospitals are required by law to provide, what exactly is being "removed" from the rolls?

### What the Bill Actually Does

The reconciliation bill Langworthy supported (which became part of H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act) includes:

**Medicaid eligibility verification requirements:**
- Enhanced documentation requirements for citizenship/immigration status
- More frequent re-verification of eligibility
- States required to check immigration databases

**What it does NOT do:**
- It does not "remove illegal aliens from Medicaid" because they were never eligible for enrollment in the first place
- It does not change Emergency Medicaid (hospitals still must provide emergency care)
- It does not address the fundamental eligibility rules established in 1996

### The Impact on Rural Healthcare

**What this rhetoric obscures:**

While claiming to "remove illegal aliens," the bill Langworthy supported actually:
- Cuts **$911 billion from Medicaid** over 10 years
- Reduces coverage for **1.3 million dually eligible** seniors and people with disabilities (per CBO)
- Threatens rural hospitals already at risk of closure

**NY-23 context:**
- 45% of NY rural hospitals at immediate risk of closure (CHQPR analysis)
- Medicaid covers approximately 25-30% of rural hospital revenue
- Rural communities disproportionately affected by coverage reductions

### The Pattern

This is not an isolated claim. Langworthy has repeatedly used immigration rhetoric to justify healthcare cuts that primarily affect U.S. citizens:

| Date | Claim | Actual Impact |
|------|-------|--------------|
| May 2025 | "Removing illegal aliens from Medicaid" | $911B in cuts to program serving citizens |
| May 2025 | "Not a single person" loses coverage | CBO: 1.3M+ dually eligible lose Medicaid |
| Dec 2024 | Blamed "illegal immigrants" for healthcare costs | Voted for bill cutting rural hospital funding |

### Additional Context: State vs. Federal Programs

**Some states provide limited health programs using STATE funds:**
- New York's Emergency Medicaid Plus covers some prenatal care
- California and a few other states have limited coverage for specific populations
- These are STATE-funded programs, not federal Medicaid

**Langworthy's claim specifically references federal reconciliation legislation**, which does not affect state-only programs.

### Questions This Raises

1. If undocumented immigrants have been ineligible for Medicaid since 1996, what is actually being "removed"?

2. Why use immigration rhetoric to justify cuts that primarily affect U.S. citizens in rural communities?

3. How many NY-23 constituents understand that Emergency Medicaid is hospital reimbursement for legally-required care, not insurance coverage?

4. Does claiming to "remove illegal aliens" from Medicaid misrepresent the actual impact of $911 billion in cuts to rural healthcare?
