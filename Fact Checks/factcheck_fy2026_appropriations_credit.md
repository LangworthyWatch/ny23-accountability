## FY2026 Appropriations: Langworthy's Funding Blitz — What He Claims, What the Record Shows
**February 11, 2026**

### Overview

Between January 12 and February 4, 2026, Rep. Nick Langworthy issued a wave of announcements claiming credit for over $13.9 million in federal funding across NY-23. The announcements span two separate appropriations bills and cover water/sewer infrastructure, a community center, a college grant, and a private company investment. This fact-check examines each claim against the legislative record, explains how the earmark process works, and identifies which projects were bipartisan efforts that no single officeholder can claim sole credit for.

## How Federal Funding Actually Works: A Guide for Constituents

Many readers have asked where this funding comes from and whether it's related to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). It's not. Here's how the different types of federal funding work:

### Type 1: Community Project Funding (CPF) — House Earmarks
- **What it is:** House members request specific dollar amounts for specific projects in their districts
- **Who decides:** The House Appropriations Committee reviews requests, the full House and Senate vote on the bill, and the President signs it into law
- **Limits:** Each House member may submit up to 15 project requests per year
- **Transparency:** All requests are posted publicly on members' websites and in CPF tables published by the Appropriations Committee
- **Key point:** This is the ONE type of funding where a Representative can legitimately say they "secured" it — they submitted the request and it was included in law
- **Where to verify:** [House Appropriations FY26 CPF Tables](https://appropriations.house.gov/fy26-member-requests/fy26-community-project-funding)

### Type 2: Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) — Senate Earmarks
- **What it is:** The identical process on the Senate side — Senators request funding for specific projects
- **Who decides:** The Senate Appropriations Committee reviews requests; same bill, same vote
- **Key point:** When BOTH a House CPF and a Senate CDS request exist for the same project, the funding is inherently **bipartisan and bicameral** — no single officeholder can claim sole credit
- **Where to verify:** [Senate Appropriations FY26 CDS Tables](https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/fy-2026-congressionally-directed-spending)

### Type 3: Competitive Federal Grants
- **What it is:** Federal agencies (EPA, USDA, DOT, etc.) award grants through merit-based applications
- **Who decides:** Agency staff score applications; members of Congress do NOT control outcomes
- **Key point:** When a Representative announces a competitive grant as "secured" or "delivered," that language overstates their role — the agency awarded it, often through a program Congress didn't create
- **Langworthy's previous pattern:** Announcing competitive grants from Biden-era programs as personal victories (see: Infrastructure Credit fact-check, Dec 2025)

### Type 4: Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) Formula Funding
- **What it is:** Funding authorized by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law (P.L. 117-58)
- **Who decides:** About 60% flows to states by statutory formula (population, road conditions, etc.); about 40% is competitive grants
- **Key point:** No individual member of Congress directs where IIJA formula money goes. Langworthy was elected in 2022, after IIJA passed
- **None of the funding in this fact-check is IIJA money.** These are all FY2026 earmarks in annual appropriations bills

### Where to Look It Up Yourself

| Who | Where to Find Their Requests | What to Look For |
|-----|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Rep. Langworthy (House)** | [FY26 Appropriations Requests](https://langworthy.house.gov/services/appropriations-requests/appropriations-requests-fy26) | His submitted CPF requests |
| **Sen. Schumer (Senate)** | [CDS Disclosures](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/services/congressionally-directed-spending) | His submitted CDS requests |
| **Sen. Gillibrand (Senate)** | [FY26 CDS Requests](https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/appropriation/fy26-appropriations-requests/) | Her submitted CDS requests |
| **House Approps Committee** | [FY26 CPF Tables](https://appropriations.house.gov/fy26-member-requests/fy26-community-project-funding) | Final funded items with requestor names |
| **Senate Approps Committee** | [FY26 CDS Tables](https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/fy-2026-congressionally-directed-spending) | Final funded items with requestor names |

The CPF/CDS tables are the definitive record. They show every funded project, the dollar amount, and — critically — **which members of Congress requested it on each side.** If both a House member and a Senator appear, it was a joint effort.

## The Two Appropriations Bills

| Bill | Public Law | Signed | Contents |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **H.R. 6938** | P.L. 119-74 | Jan 23, 2026 | CJS, Energy & Water, Interior & Environment |
| **H.R. 7148** | P.L. 119-75 | Feb 3, 2026 | THUD, Agriculture, and others |

Both passed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities. H.R. 6938 passed the House 397-28 and cleared Senate cloture 80-13.

## Claim-by-Claim Analysis

### 1. EPA Water/Sewer Infrastructure Claims (Division C, P.L. 119-74)

Langworthy requested and received 8 earmarks through the EPA State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) program.

#### Clean Water State Revolving Fund (Wastewater/Stormwater)

| Project | Amount | Langworthy CPF | Senate CDS Match? |
|---------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| City of Jamestown Stormwater Channel | $1,250,000 | YES | **No match found** |
| Town of Dix Water & Sewer Extension | $1,000,000 | YES | **YES — Schumer/Gillibrand** |
| Town of Elma Consolidated Wastewater | $1,000,000 | YES | **YES — Schumer/Gillibrand** |
| City of Corning Wastewater Boiler | $984,000 | YES | **No match found** |
| Town of Randolph Sanitary Sewer | $1,000,000 | YES | **No match found** |

#### Drinking Water State Revolving Fund

| Project | Amount | Langworthy CPF | Senate CDS Match? |
|---------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| City of Olean Water Treatment Plant | $1,000,000 | YES | **No match found** |
| Town of Ellicott Water Service Extension | $1,000,000 | YES | **YES — Schumer/Gillibrand** |
| Allegany County Water System | $1,250,000 | YES | **YES — Schumer/Gillibrand** |

**Subtotal: $8,484,000 in EPA STAG earmarks**

#### The Bipartisan Reality Langworthy Doesn't Mention

**Four of the eight EPA earmarks were joint House-Senate efforts.** Schumer and Gillibrand submitted matching CDS requests for Town of Dix, Town of Elma, Town of Ellicott, and Allegany County — and issued their own press releases claiming credit for them:

- **Jan 8-9, 2026:** Schumer/Gillibrand announced $3.6M for WNY water projects (including Ellicott and Elma) and $2.25M for Southern Tier water projects (including Dix and Allegany County)
- **Jan 12-15, 2026:** Langworthy announced the same projects, crediting only himself
- **Neither side credited the other**

For the remaining four (Olean, Jamestown, Corning, Randolph), no matching Senate CDS request was found in press releases or news coverage. These appear to be Langworthy-only requests — making his sole credit claim stronger for those projects.

#### Verdict: ACCURATE for funding claims — MISLEADING on credit for joint projects

**What Langworthy gets right:**
- These ARE legitimate earmarks he requested through the CPF process
- All projects are in NY-23 and address real infrastructure needs
- For the 4 projects with no Senate match, his sole credit claim is defensible

**What Langworthy's announcements obscure:**

1. **Bipartisan omission on 4 of 8 projects:** The Dix, Elma, Ellicott, and Allegany County projects were joint efforts with Schumer and Gillibrand. Neither Langworthy's press releases nor his social media graphics mention the Senate partners. (To be fair, the Senators don't mention Langworthy either — but the pattern of sole credit-claiming is the focus of this fact-check.)

2. **Premature announcement timing:** Langworthy announced these on **January 12-15, 2026** — before H.R. 6938 was signed into law on **January 23, 2026**. His graphics said "SECURED" and "DELIVERED" — past tense — for funding that had not yet been enacted.

3. **Mixed language:** Some graphics say "SECURED" (Olean, Ellicott, Randolph). Others say "DELIVERED" (Dix). "Deliver" implies completed action for funding not yet signed into law.

---

### 2. Town of Newstead Community Center — $5,000,000

**Langworthy's claim:** "DELIVERED $5 Million TO CONSTRUCT THE NEWSTEAD SENIOR CENTER"

**The facts:**
- **Bill:** H.R. 7148, Division D (THUD), signed as P.L. 119-75 on February 3, 2026
- **Mechanism:** Joint CPF (House) and CDS (Senate) — bipartisan, bicameral
- **Newstead is in NY-23:** YES (Erie County portion of the district)
- **Senate CDS match:** YES — Schumer and Gillibrand both submitted matching requests

#### Verdict: ACCURATE on funding — MISLEADING on sole credit — INACCURATE project name

**The bipartisan omission — documented in detail:**

The Town Supervisor herself acknowledged the bipartisan nature. Dawn D. Izydorczak is quoted in the **Gillibrand/Schumer press release** (Feb 4, 2026): "With the help of Congressman Langworthy, **working in a bi-partisan effort with Senator Schumer**, the Town will now be able to begin work on a very important project for our community."

**But Langworthy's press release (same day):**
- Claims sole credit: "I was proud to secure this $5 million investment"
- Makes **no mention of Schumer or Gillibrand** whatsoever
- Uses a **different, shorter quote** from the same Town Supervisor that omits the bipartisan acknowledgment

**The contrast:**
- Schumer/Gillibrand release: Credits Langworthy by name, acknowledges bipartisan effort
- Langworthy release: Claims sole credit, omits Senate partners entirely

**The naming issue:**
- Langworthy's graphic says "NEWSTEAD SENIOR CENTER"
- The actual project is a 32,000 sq. ft. **Community Center** serving all ages — Senior Center (880+ members), youth recreation (350+ youth), emergency warming shelter
- Calling it a "Senior Center" narrows the project's scope and targets a specific voter demographic

---

### 3. Elmira College Technology Grant — $480,000

**Langworthy's claim (Jan 23, 2026):** "I'm proud to deliver this $480,000 grant to Elmira College."

#### ✅ RESOLVED: Funding Source Identified

**The Elmira College grant is a legitimate CPF earmark** in Division A (Commerce, Justice, Science) of H.R. 6938 / P.L. 119-74.

**Specifics from the CJS CPF Table:**
- **Agency:** Department of Commerce
- **Account:** NIST — Scientific and Technical Research and Services (STRS)
- **Project:** Elmira College Technology Upgrade to Enhance Science Research and Instruction
- **Amount:** $480,000
- **Requestor — House:** Langworthy
- **Requestor — Senate:** None listed
- **Origination:** H (House only)

**CPF Table source:** [FY26 CJS CPF Table (PDF)](https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/fy26-cjs-cpf-table.pdf)

#### Verdict: ACCURATE — Langworthy-only earmark, legitimately "secured"

This is a **House-only CPF item with no Senate match** — Langworthy's sole credit claim is fully defensible here.

**Why this matters for constituents asking about it:**
- This is NOT Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) money
- This is NOT a Biden-era competitive grant
- This IS a congressionally directed earmark that Langworthy personally requested through NIST
- The funding comes from the Department of Commerce, not the Department of Education (which is why it wasn't affected by the FY2025 CR that eliminated Education earmarks)
- It was requested on Langworthy's FY2025 and FY2026 appropriations request pages and funded in the FY2026 bill

**Note:** Neither Langworthy's press release nor local news coverage identified the funding agency (NIST/Commerce). The CPF table is the only public document linking this to a specific federal account. Constituents who want to understand where their federal tax dollars are going shouldn't have to dig through appropriations committee PDFs to find out.

---

### 4. Siemens Energy / Painted Post — $64 Million Investment

**Langworthy's claim (Feb 3, 2026):** "Siemens Energy's $64 million investment in its Painted Post facility is fantastic news for our 23rd Congressional District and the entire Southern Tier."

#### Verdict: LEGITIMATE LOCAL CELEBRATION — Not a credit claim

This is a **private company decision** driven by surging electricity demand from data centers and AI, part of Siemens Energy's $1 billion nationwide U.S. manufacturing expansion. Langworthy is celebrating local economic news, not claiming he caused it. No fact-check issue.

---

## The Complete Bipartisan Picture

This is the most significant finding of this fact-check. **Five of Langworthy's ten earmarks were joint efforts with Schumer and Gillibrand** — and none of the three officeholders credited the others in their own announcements.

### Joint House-Senate Earmarks (Bipartisan)

| Project | Amount | Langworthy Credits Senators? | Senators Credit Langworthy? |
|---------|--------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Town of Dix Water & Sewer | $1M | **NO** | **NO** |
| Town of Elma Wastewater | $1M | **NO** | **NO** |
| Town of Ellicott Water Extension | $1M | **NO** | **NO** |
| Allegany County Water System | $1.25M | **NO** | **NO** |
| Newstead Community Center | $5M | **NO** | **YES** — Town Supervisor quote credits Langworthy |

**Total joint funding: $9.25M** — more than half of the total claimed by Langworthy

### Langworthy-Only Earmarks (House CPF, no Senate CDS match found)

| Project | Amount | Division | Bill |
|---------|--------|----------|------|
| City of Olean Water Plant | $1M | C (Interior) | P.L. 119-74 |
| City of Jamestown Stormwater | $1.25M | C (Interior) | P.L. 119-74 |
| City of Corning Wastewater Boiler | $984K | C (Interior) | P.L. 119-74 |
| Town of Randolph Sewer | $1M | C (Interior) | P.L. 119-74 |
| Elmira College Tech Upgrade | $480K | A (CJS) | P.L. 119-74 |

**Total Langworthy-only funding: $4.714M** — these are the projects where sole credit is fully defensible

### What This Means

When Langworthy says he "delivered over $20 million in federal funding" through Community Project Funding, constituents should understand that a significant portion of that total represents **bipartisan efforts where Democratic Senators submitted matching requests.** The funding wouldn't have become law without votes from both parties in both chambers.

This doesn't diminish Langworthy's role — submitting CPF requests is real constituent service. But presenting joint projects as solo achievements is misleading, especially when the Senators' office shows more transparency by crediting the bipartisan nature (at least in the Newstead case).

## Summary Table

| Claim | Amount | Type | Bill/Division | Solo or Joint? | Rating |
|-------|--------|------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| City of Olean Water Plant | $1M | CPF | P.L. 119-74 / Div C | **Solo** | **ACCURATE** |
| City of Jamestown Stormwater | $1.25M | CPF | P.L. 119-74 / Div C | **Solo** | **ACCURATE** |
| City of Corning Wastewater Boiler | $984K | CPF | P.L. 119-74 / Div C | **Solo** | **ACCURATE** |
| Town of Randolph Sewer | $1M | CPF | P.L. 119-74 / Div C | **Solo** | **ACCURATE** |
| Elmira College Tech Upgrade | $480K | CPF | P.L. 119-74 / Div A | **Solo** | **ACCURATE** |
| Town of Dix Water/Sewer | $1M | CPF + CDS | P.L. 119-74 / Div C | **Joint** | **ACCURATE but omits Senate partners** |
| Town of Elma Wastewater | $1M | CPF + CDS | P.L. 119-74 / Div C | **Joint** | **ACCURATE but omits Senate partners** |
| Town of Ellicott Water | $1M | CPF + CDS | P.L. 119-74 / Div C | **Joint** | **ACCURATE but omits Senate partners** |
| Allegany County Water | $1.25M | CPF + CDS | P.L. 119-74 / Div C | **Joint** | **ACCURATE but omits Senate partners** |
| Newstead Community Center | $5M | CPF + CDS | P.L. 119-75 / Div D | **Joint** | **ACCURATE but omits Senate partners; misnames project** |
| Siemens Energy/Painted Post | $64M | Private | N/A | N/A | **LEGITIMATE — not a credit claim** |

## Questions This Raises

1. **Why does Langworthy never mention Schumer or Gillibrand on joint projects?** Five of his ten earmarks had matching Senate CDS requests. The Senators' office credited Langworthy by name in the Newstead case. Langworthy credited no one.

2. **Why did Langworthy announce earmarks as "DELIVERED" before the bill was signed?** H.R. 6938 was signed January 23, but announcements began January 12-15.

3. **Why doesn't anyone identify the funding source for the Elmira College grant?** It took reviewing the CJS CPF table to determine this was a NIST/Commerce Department earmark. Neither Langworthy, Elmira College, nor local media identified the specific federal program.

4. **Why call the Newstead project a "Senior Center"?** The project is a full community center serving seniors, youth, and the entire community — including an emergency warming shelter.

5. **How does constituents' confusion about funding sources (IIJA vs. earmarks) benefit officeholders?** When people don't understand where money comes from, any officeholder can claim credit. Transparency about the CPF/CDS process would let voters evaluate claims accurately.

## The Bigger Picture: Earmarks vs. Competitive Grants

This batch of announcements represents a **meaningful shift** from the pattern documented in the existing Infrastructure Credit fact-check.

### Previous Pattern (2023-2025)
- Langworthy announced **competitive federal grants** (USDA Rural Development, EDA, etc.)
- These were grants awarded by federal agencies through merit-based processes
- Langworthy used language like "secured" and "delivered" for funding he had no direct role in awarding
- Biden administration programs and IIJA funding went unacknowledged
- Credit was disconnected from policy source

### Current Pattern (Jan-Feb 2026)
- Langworthy is announcing **his own earmarks** — Community Project Funding items he personally requested
- Using "secured" for earmarks is **more defensible** than using it for competitive grants
- The CPF tables publicly list him as the requestor
- This represents actual constituent service through the appropriations process

### What's Still the Same
- Premature announcements before bills are signed into law
- Omitting bipartisan partners on joint projects
- Vague or missing funding source details
- Strategic language choices ("DELIVERED" vs. "secured")
- Sole credit framing for bipartisan achievements
