## Farm Bill: Claiming "Victory" and Blaming Democrats for Legislation That Never Received a Floor Vote
**December 30, 2025**

### Statement
**Source:** Press Releases, Public Statements  
**Reported by:** Langworthy.house.gov, Observer Today, Post-Journal

**May 24, 2024:** "I'm proud to have fought for Western New York and the Southern Tier to have a seat at the table... I look forward to supporting it on the House floor."

**May 17, 2024:** Langworthy touted that his six sponsored bills were included in the Farm Bill text, calling it a "major victory" for NY-23 farmers.

**January 10, 2025:** "I was disappointed we couldn't get bipartisan cooperation to get the Farm Bill passed in the last Congress."

### The Legislative Record

**The 2024 Farm Bill (Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024):**

- Passed House Agriculture Committee: 33-21 (May 23, 2024)
- Received floor vote: **NEVER**
- Became law: **NO**
- Langworthy's six bills became law: **NO**

**Timeline:**
- May 23, 2024: Committee passage
- May 24, 2024: Langworthy press release celebrating
- May - December 2024: Speaker Mike Johnson never scheduled floor vote
- January 3, 2025: 118th Congress ended, bill died
- January 10, 2025: Langworthy blames Democrats for failure

### The Bills That Didn't Become Law

**Langworthy's six bills included in the Farm Bill text:**

1. **H.R. 565 - GRAPE Act** (crop insurance for freeze damage)
2. **H.R. 3550** (dairy pricing formula)
3. **H.R. 3638** (maple syrup producer support)
4. **Three additional agriculture provisions**

**Status of all six:** Never enacted into law because the Farm Bill never passed.

### Why It Didn't Pass

**Committee Vote Breakdown:**
- Yes: 33 (all Republicans)
- No: 21 (19 Democrats + 2 Republicans)
- Only 4 Democrats voted yes

**Democratic opposition focused on:**
- Partisan SNAP work requirement provisions
- Cuts to nutrition programs
- Lack of meaningful Democratic input in drafting

**Republican leadership decision:**
Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) never scheduled the bill for a floor vote despite:
- Republican majority in the House
- Ability to bring bills to the floor
- Langworthy publicly calling for floor action

### The April 2024 Frost: Still Unaddressed

**What happened:**
April 18-19, 2024: Devastating frost hit NY-23
- Chautauqua County: 75% of grape crop destroyed
- Estimated $220 million in losses
- Cherry, apple, peach orchards also affected

**Langworthy's response:**
Visited affected farms, issued press releases, highlighted the GRAPE Act as the solution.

**The problem:**
The GRAPE Act was in a Farm Bill that never passed. NY-23 growers got press coverage but no actual federal relief.

**As of December 2025:**
Growers still have no expanded crop insurance for freeze damage because the GRAPE Act never became law.

### The Pattern of "Committee Victories"

**Langworthy has a pattern of claiming legislative victories at the committee stage:**

| Date | Claim | Actual Result |
|------|-------|--------------|
| May 2024 | GRAPE Act "major victory" | Bill never passed House floor |
| May 2024 | Dairy pricing "secured" | Provision never became law |
| May 2024 | Maple syrup support "delivered" | Provision never became law |

**Committee passage ≠ Law**

The legislative process requires:
1. Committee approval ✓ (accomplished)
2. Floor vote ✗ (never happened)
3. Senate passage ✗ (couldn't happen without House vote)
4. President's signature ✗ (couldn't happen without Senate passage)

### Who Actually Blocked the Farm Bill?

**Langworthy's January 2025 claim:**
"I was disappointed we couldn't get bipartisan cooperation to get the Farm Bill passed in the last Congress."

**The facts:**
- Republicans held House majority (controlled floor schedule)
- Republican Speaker chose not to schedule vote
- Bill was crafted without meaningful Democratic input (hence 19 of 21 Democrats voted no in committee)
- No Democratic actions prevented floor vote—Speaker simply didn't schedule it

**If Republicans wanted floor vote:**
They could have held one at any time between May and December 2024.

### What NY-23 Farmers Actually Got

**Press releases:** Multiple announcements about Langworthy's "fight" for farmers

**Actual policy changes:** Zero

**Federal assistance for April 2024 frost damage:** None from the GRAPE Act (which didn't pass)

**Dairy pricing reform:** No changes (provision didn't pass)

**Maple syrup producer support:** No changes (provision didn't pass)

### The 2025 Context

**A new Farm Bill must be negotiated in the 119th Congress.**

Langworthy's six bills are not automatically included in the new bill—they would need to be reintroduced and included in new Farm Bill text.

**As of December 2025:**
- No new Farm Bill has passed
- NY-23 farmers still lack the protections Langworthy claimed to have "secured" in May 2024

### Questions This Raises

1. Why did Langworthy characterize committee passage as a "major victory" when the bill never received a floor vote?

2. Why blame Democrats for lack of "bipartisan cooperation" when the Republican Speaker never scheduled the vote?

3. Did claiming victory at the committee stage mislead NY-23 farmers about whether they had federal protections?

4. After the April 2024 frost devastated crops, why didn't Langworthy push Republican leadership to bring the Farm Bill to a floor vote?

5. When Langworthy says he "fought for" and "secured" provisions for farmers, does that mean committee passage or actual enacted law?
