## Correspondence Tracker Update

### Updated Metrics

| Metric | Previous | Updated |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Total Letters Documented** | 2 | 6 |
| **Form Letters** | 2 of 2 (100%) | 6 of 6 (100%) |
| **Responses After Vote Cast** | 2 of 2 (100%) | 3 of 6 (50%) |
| **Responses Addressing Constituent's Concern** | 0 of 2 (0%) | 0 of 6 (0%) |

### Pattern: All Letters Are Form Letters

Evidence from January 2026 batch:
- All four sent within 7-minute window (7:18-7:25 PM)
- Identical opening formula: "Thank you for contacting me to express your [support/concerns/opposition]..."
- Identical closing: "My door is always open, and I am honored to serve Western New York and the Southern Tier."
- Same signature image across all four

This is standard congressional office practice but confirms these are automated responses from a constituent correspondence management system.

## Strongest Finding: Epstein Files

The Epstein letter contains the most significant documented contradiction:

**Langworthy claims:** "I have never opposed the release of the documents"

**The record shows:**
1. **July 14, 2025:** Voted NO on Democratic amendment to release files
2. **Sept 2 - Nov 12, 2025:** Did NOT sign discharge petition (only 4 Republicans did: Massie, Greene, Boebert, Mace)
3. **Sept 26, 2025:** Rep. Pat Ryan publicly called out Langworthy by name for refusing to sign
4. **Nov 17, 2025:** Trump reversed position
5. **Nov 18, 2025:** Langworthy voted YES (along with 426 others, passing 427-1)

**The gap:** Langworthy claims "proud support" for transparency while the bill only reached a vote because Democrats + 4 Republican dissenters forced it over administration opposition—which Langworthy did not defy.
