  "full_text": "December 5, 2025\nPress Release\nEnergy Choice Act Clears Final Hurdle Before Heading to House Floor\nWASHINGTON, D.C.\n\u2013 Congressman Nick Langworthy (NY-23) announced today that his legislation, the\nEnergy Choice Act\n, has passed out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, clearing the final hurdle for the bill to come before the full U.S. House of Representatives. The bill passed out of the Energy Subcommittee last week and support has grown to 140 bipartisan co-sponsors from across the country.\nThe Energy Choice Act (H.R.3699) prohibits states and local governments from banning an energy service's connection, reconnection, modification, installation, or expansion based on the type or source of energy to be delivered. Congressman Langworthy, who serves as a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and as a member of the Energy and Environment subcommittees, has made protecting Americans\u2019 energy options a top priority.\nCongressman Langworthy has been traveling across New York\u2019s 23\nrd\nCongressional District to meet with homeowners and businesses about Governor Hochul\u2019s looming statewide natural gas and propane ban, and the disastrous effect it will have on energy costs, access, and reliability.\nThe Energy Choice Act has been gaining significant momentum across the state of New York, with more than 200 local governments passing resolutions in support of the legislation. It has also garnered the support of dozens of industry stakeholders. The companion bill is being carried by U.S. Senator Jim Justice of West Virginia.\n\u201cToday marks a huge step forward in my fight to protect New Yorkers\u2019 access to affordable, reliable energy options,\u201d said Congressman Nick Langworthy. \u201cAdvancing this bill out of committee means we can bring this bill before the full House where it has bipartisan support from both Republicans and common-sense Democrats. Albany\u2019s war on natural gas is an illogical, dangerous infringement on your rights, your pocketbooks, and your safety. I\u2019m proud to lead this fight and I won\u2019t stop until we get this bill on the President\u2019s desk for his signature.\u201d\nNoting Hochul\u2019s move to delay implementation until next year, Congressman Langworthy concluded, \u201cKathy Hochul is simply trying to buy time to avoid the political fallout that will come from her disastrous law, but make no mistake: if we don\u2019t stop her at the federal level, this will soon be every New Yorker\u2019s nightmare.\u201d\nSupporting Organizations:\nAmerican Exploration and Production Council (AXPC)\nAmerican Gas Association (AGA)\nAmerican Petroleum Institute (API)\nAmerican Public Gas Association (APGA)\nAmericans for Prosperity (AFP)\nConcerned Veterans for America (CVA)\nConsumer\u00a0Energy\u00a0Alliance (CEA)\nEnergy\u00a0Marketers of America (EMA)\nGPA Midstream Association\nGPSA Midstream Suppliers, Hearth\nPatio & Barbecue Association (HPBA)\nInterstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA)\nThe LIBRE Initiative\nNational Association of Home Builders (NAHB)\nNational Association of Oil and\u00a0Energy\u00a0Service Professionals (OESP)\nNational\u00a0Energy\u00a0and Fuels Institute (NEFI)\nNational Hispanic\u00a0Energy\u00a0Council\nNational Propane Gas Association (NPGA)\nPlumbing Heating Cooling Contractors \u2013 National Association (PHCC)\nPool & Hot Tub Alliance (PHTA)\nNational Ocean Industries Association (NOIA)\nEnergy\u00a0Workforce and Technology Council\nPellet Fuel Institute\nAtmos\u00a0Energy\nAmerican Supply Association (ASA)\nAmerica First Policy Institute (AFPI)\nFertilizer Institute\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce\nNational Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB)\nInstitute for Legislative Analysis\nIndustrial\u00a0Energy\u00a0Consumers of America (IECA)\nClean Fuels Alliance\nBaker Commodities\nDigital\u00a0Energy\u00a0Council\nAmerican Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers\nIndependent Petroleum Association of America\nNational Gas Supply Association\nIssues\n:\nEnergy",
