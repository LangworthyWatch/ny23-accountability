  "full_text": "August 25, 2025\nPress Release\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013\nCongressman Nick Langworthy (NY-23) today applauds President Trump\u2019s\nexecutive order\nending cashless bail in Washington, D.C., restoring law and order to the Nation\u2019s Capital, and calls on Governor Kathy Hochul to do the same in New York State.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad state of affairs when the President of the United States has to step in and do the job local officials should be doing to keep people safe. In New York, Governor Hochul and Albany Democrats have unleashed a wave of tragic and entirely preventable crimes. The supporters of these disastrous pro-criminal policies have blood on their hands.\n\u201cI strongly support President Trump\u2019s Executive Order to restore law and order, and I urge Congressional leadership to act to codify it so we can end this madness in pro-criminal, anti-police states like New York. The radical Left\u2019s obsession with coddling criminals has left a trail of victims whose lives will never be the same.\nNew Yorkers deserve leaders who put the safety of law-abiding citizens ahead of violent offenders. Thankfully, President Trump is once again leading where Democrats have failed\u2014bringing safety, accountability, and common sense back to our government.\u201d\n###\nIssues\n:\nNew York State",
